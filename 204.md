# Lack of Validation for Liquidation Thresholds

### Summary

The executeLiquidationCall function does not enforce sufficient checks for minimum leftover collateral after liquidation.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L341 the executeLiquidationCall function does not enforce sufficient checks for minimum leftover collateral after liquidation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

An attacker could create "dust" positions by liquidating only partial amounts that cannot be efficiently liquidated later.
Exploit Feasibility: This can result in inefficient protocol operations, with the protocol unable to collect or clear these leftover amounts as shown below.

contract LiquidationThresholdExploit {
    LiquidationLogic public liquidationLogic;

    constructor(address _liquidationLogic) {
        liquidationLogic = LiquidationLogic(_liquidationLogic);
    }

    function exploitDustCreation(
        address collateralAsset,
        address debtAsset,
        address user,
        uint256 partialDebtToCover
    ) external {
        // Step 1: Call executeLiquidationCall with an amount that leaves "dust"
        LiquidationLogic.ExecuteLiquidationCallParams memory params = LiquidationLogic
            .ExecuteLiquidationCallParams({
                collateralAsset: collateralAsset,
                debtAsset: debtAsset,
                user: user,
                debtToCover: partialDebtToCover,
                reservesCount: 2,
                priceOracle: address(0), // use legitimate oracle
                userEModeCategory: 0,
                priceOracleSentinel: address(0),
                receiveAToken: false
            });

        liquidationLogic.executeLiquidationCall(
            /* pass required reserves data, users config, and other parameters */
            params
        );

        // Step 2: The protocol now has leftover dust that is uneconomical to liquidate.
    }
}


### Impact

An attacker could exploit this logic to bypass threshold checks by manipulating the collateral or debt amounts during liquidation.
This could leave the protocol with unliquidatable "dust" positions, leading to inefficiencies.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a fixed minimum liquidation amount to ensure meaningful debt repayments and collateral liquidations.
