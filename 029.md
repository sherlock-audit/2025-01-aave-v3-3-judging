# Missing Check for Active Reserve Status Allows Borrowing from Disabled Reserves

### Summary  
The lack of a check to ensure the reserve is active in the `executeBorrow` function will cause unintended borrowing from disabled reserves, allowing users to exploit reserves that should not permit borrowing.

---

### Root Cause  
There is no validation to confirm that the reserve's status is active before processing the borrow. Reserves can be temporarily disabled for maintenance or risk management, and the absence of this check enables borrowing from reserves that should not be accessible.  

#### Code Snippet:  
```solidity  
DataTypes.ReserveData storage reserve = reservesData[params.asset];
// Missing reserve status validation (e.g., reserve.isActive)
reserve.updateState(reserveCache);
```

In the `ReserveLogic` library, reserves have configurations stored in the [DataTypes.ReserveConfigurationMap](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ReserveLogic.sol#L27). [This includes the](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/configuration/ReserveConfiguration.sol#L183-L185) **`isActive`** flag, which is intended to determine whether a reserve is available for operations like borrowing, repaying, or supplying liquidity. However, **`BorrowLogic.executeBorrow` does not check this flag before proceeding with state updates**. The `getActive` function explicitly checks the `ACTIVE_MASK` bit in the reserve's configuration:

```solidity
function getActive(DataTypes.ReserveConfigurationMap memory self) internal pure returns (bool) {
    return (self.data & ACTIVE_MASK) != 0;
}
```
This clearly indicates that reserves have an active state flag designed to enable or disable operations like borrowing or supplying liquidity. However, this state is not being validated in the `executeBorrow` function of `BorrowLogic`.
From `ReserveLogic.sol`, reserves [maintain their configurations](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ReserveLogic.sol#L295-L296) via the `ReserveConfiguration` library:  

```solidity  
reserveCache.reserveConfiguration = reserve.configuration;
reserveCache.reserveFactor = reserveCache.reserveConfiguration.getReserveFactor();
```

The `ReserveConfiguration` library provides a method (`getActive`) to retrieve the **active status** of a reserve:  

```solidity  
function getActive(DataTypes.ReserveConfigurationMap storage self) internal view returns (bool) {
    return (self.data & ~ACTIVE_MASK) != 0;
}
```
When `BorrowLogic.executeBorrow` fetches a reserve's data, it does not validate the reserve's active status. For instance:  

```solidity  
DataTypes.ReserveData storage reserve = reservesData[params.asset];
// Missing check for reserve.isActive or equivalent
reserve.updateState(reserveCache);
```

Without this validation, the protocol will process borrowing operations on a reserve that may be disabled due to maintenance, risk mitigation, or other factors, leading to unintended consequences.

---

### Internal Pre-conditions  
1. **Reserve** is marked as inactive (e.g., for maintenance or risk mitigation).  
2. **User** attempts to borrow from the inactive reserve.  

---

### External Pre-conditions  
1. The reserve is disabled on-chain but still has sufficient liquidity.  

---

### Attack Path  
1. **User** identifies a reserve that is disabled but lacks an active status check in `executeBorrow`.  
2. The user borrows from the reserve despite it being marked as inactive.  
3. The protocol fails to enforce its intended restrictions, allowing unintended borrowing.  

---

### Impact  
The **protocol** suffers potential financial and operational risks by enabling borrowing from reserves that are supposed to be inactive. This may lead to reserve depletion or destabilization.  

---

### Mitigation  
Add a validation step in `executeBorrow` to ensure the reserve is active before processing the borrowing logic:  

```solidity  
require(reserve.isActive, "Reserve is not active for borrowing");
```
