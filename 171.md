# Improper validation of liquidation calls can lead to failure in liquidating users with health-factor exactly at `0.95`.

### Summary

In aave, a liquidation can only be performed once a users health-factor drops below 1, and at health factor `<=0.95` the CLOSE_FACTOR of 100% is used. The function [executeLiquidationCall()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L200) called through `pool.sol` is used to liquidate users. This function uses [validateLiquidationCall()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L381) to validate the liquidation call before proceeding, but there is a scenario that exists here that prevents positions with health factor exactly = `0.95` from being liquidated.
According to the docs at health factor below 1 liquidation is allowed and at a health factor <= 0.95 liquidation of the whole position is allowed. Signifying that 0.95 is a critical health factor, meaning that at 0.95 and below the MINIMUM_HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD is severe and requires full liquidation. However, in the check at [validateLiquidationCall](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L403) liquidation is only allowed for numbers below 0.95 and not 0.95 itself.


### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is that in the validating function [validateLiquidationCall()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L381) the require statement allows only positions with health factor `less than` (<0.95) MINIMUM_HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD instead of `less than or equal to` (<=0.95). The check is designed to allow liquidation of bad positions even when the sequencer oracle (`PriceOracleSentinel`) is down or in grace period ensuring that positions with severe health factors can be liquidated.

  function validateLiquidationCall(
    DataTypes.UserConfigurationMap storage userConfig,
    DataTypes.ReserveData storage collateralReserve,
    DataTypes.ReserveData storage debtReserve,
    DataTypes.ValidateLiquidationCallParams memory params
  ) internal view {
...


    require(
      params.priceOracleSentinel == address(0) ||
@>      params.healthFactor < MINIMUM_HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD ||
        IPriceOracleSentinel(params.priceOracleSentinel).isLiquidationAllowed(),
      Errors.PRICE_ORACLE_SENTINEL_CHECK_FAILED
    );

...
}

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. [isLiquidationAllowed()]() returns false as the `sequenceroracle is down or still in `grace period` and the health factor of the position is exactly `0.95`
2. params.priceOracleSentinel == address(0) (Which should be only for ethereum mainnet)

### External Pre-conditions

1. Health factor of a user is exactly at `0.95` and should be fully liquidated regardless [isLiquidationAllowed()]() returns false or params.priceOracleSentinel == address(0) 
2. A liquidator attempts to liquidate a position with a health factor of 0.95.

### Attack Path

1. A userâ€™s position becomes vulnerable to liquidation with a health factor of 0.95.
2. The liquidator attempts to initiate liquidation via the executeLiquidationCall() function while the external and internal conditions hold.
3. The call to validateLiquidationCall() fails due to the < operator in the health factor check.
4. Liquidation cannot proceed, leaving the position unprotected and potentially increasing protocol risk.

### Impact

1. When the sequencer is down or in the grace period, positions `exactly` at the critical health factor number of `0.95` cannot be liquidated as the check will always revert.
2. It could lead to insolvency.

_No response_

### Mitigation

The < sign in [validateLiquidationCall](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L403) should be changed to <= to account for positions with health factor exactly at  `0.95` to be liquidated.
