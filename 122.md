# The assumption that users cannot borrow more than the available liquidity in the reserve can be broken

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L152C4-L166C7

The validateBorrow function is responsible for validating borrow actions in the protocol. It ensures that all conditions are met before allowing a user to borrow assets. One of the key validations is that the amount being borrowed does not exceed the reserve's available liquidity.A user cannot borrow more assets than what is available in the reserve. When virtual accounting is disabled, the validateBorrow function does not properly enforce this restriction, allowing users to borrow more than the reserveâ€™s available liquidity.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L152C4-L166C7

    require(vars.isActive, Errors.RESERVE_INACTIVE);
    require(!vars.isPaused, Errors.RESERVE_PAUSED);
    require(!vars.isFrozen, Errors.RESERVE_FROZEN);
    require(vars.borrowingEnabled, Errors.BORROWING_NOT_ENABLED);
    require(
      !params.reserveCache.reserveConfiguration.getIsVirtualAccActive() ||
        IERC20(params.reserveCache.aTokenAddress).totalSupply() >= params.amount,
      Errors.INVALID_AMOUNT
    );


    require(
      params.priceOracleSentinel == address(0) ||
        IPriceOracleSentinel(params.priceOracleSentinel).isBorrowAllowed(),
      Errors.PRICE_ORACLE_SENTINEL_CHECK_FAILED
    );

The condition is intended to ensure that when virtual accounting is active, the total supply of aTokens (which represents the reserve's liquidity) is sufficient to cover the borrow amount.
The logical OR operator || means that if virtual accounting is not active, the condition passes without checking the available liquidity.

When virtual accounting is disabled (getIsVirtualAccActive() returns false), the left side of the || operator evaluates to true, causing the entire condition to pass regardless of the right side.
This means the protocol does not check if there is sufficient liquidity when virtual accounting is disabled.
Users can borrow any amount, even exceeding the reserve's available liquidity.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

A reserve has virtual accounting disabled.
Available liquidity in the reserve: 100 tokens.
A user attempts to borrow: 150 tokens.

The condition in validateBorrow simplifies as follows:

!false || /* right side not evaluated */
Since !false is true, the entire condition passes without evaluating the right side.

The user is allowed to borrow 150 tokens, even though only 100 tokens are available.
This overdraws the reserve by 50 tokens.

### Impact

Overdrawing reserves can lead to insolvency, as the protocol might owe more assets than it holds.
Malicious users will exploit this flaw to drain the reserves, leading to systemic risks.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

require(
  IERC20(params.reserveCache.aTokenAddress).balanceOf(params.reserveCache.aTokenAddress) >= params.amount,
  Errors.INVALID_AMOUNT
);
