# Current bad debt mechanism allows for gas griefing.

### Summary
AAVE v3.3 introduces new logic which should ideally handle bad debt. In situations when after a liquidation, a user has no more collateral (in base units) but has outstanding debt, all of their debt is cleared in order to prevent further interest accrual.

```solidity
    if (hasNoCollateralLeft && userConfig.isBorrowingAny()) {
      _burnBadDebt(reservesData, reservesList, userConfig, params.reservesCount, params.user);
    }
```

The problem is that unless the user has made an isolated loan, anyone can transfer them dust amount of aTokens which would enable the asset as collateral and would require it to get liquidated in order to trigger the bad debt mechanism. A single `aToken` transfer which enables the asset as collateral costs ~85,000 gas. However, a liquidation (without bad debt clearing) costs ~160,000 gas. As 1 base unit is $0.00000001, the assets that need to be sent do not cost anything. Currently, there are more than 20 assets on Ethereum which could be used in non-isolated loans, meaning that griefer can spend ~1,700,000 gas in order to cost AAVE ~3,200,000 gas to trigger the bad debt mechanism.

At current prices on mainnet (10 gwei, ETH $3.3k), this is `10e9 * 3.2e6 * 3.3e3 / 1e18 = ~$100` in gas fees in order to trigger the bad debt mechanism. And it costs the attacker just ~$55.75 to do that. The liquidator would not have any profit to do that (as there's no valuable collateral), so this only leaves AAVE protocol to perform these actions and take the gas costs, or leave bad debt within the protocol which makes the current update useless and deals damage to the protocol itself.

It must also be noted that gas costs have historically been much higher, so losses would be even higher at such times. 


### Root Cause
Impractical code architecture.

### Impact
Losses either for the AAVE DAO or the AAVE protocol.

### PoC
The following test was ran on a live fork to get aToken gas costs
```solidity
pragma solidity ^0.8.13;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";
import {IPool} from  "../src/interfaces/IPool.sol"; 
import {IERC20} from "../src/interfaces/IERC20.sol";


contract AaveTest is Test {
    IPool aave = IPool(0x87870Bca3F3fD6335C3F4ce8392D69350B4fA4E2);
    IERC20 weth = IERC20(0xC02aaA39b223FE8D0A0e5C4F27eAD9083C756Cc2);
    IERC20 usdc = IERC20(0xA0b86991c6218b36c1d19D4a2e9Eb0cE3606eB48);
    IERC20 aUSDC = IERC20(0x98C23E9d8f34FEFb1B7BD6a91B7FF122F4e16F5c);

    address user = address(1);
    address user2 = address(2);

    function testIssue() public {
        vm.startPrank(user);
        deal(address(usdc), user, 1000e6); 
        usdc.approve(address(aave), 1000e6);

        aave.supply(address(usdc), 1000e6, user, 0);

        uint256 gasleft1 = gasleft();
        aUSDC.transfer(user2, 2000);
        uint256 gasleft2 = gasleft();
        console.log(gasleft1 - gasleft2);
    }
} 
```
And new liquidation gas costs can be checked on almost any of the tests within `Pool.Liquidations.t.sol`
