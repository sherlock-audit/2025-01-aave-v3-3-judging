# Lack of Range Validation in `setLtv` Causes Data Truncation for Protocol Users as Admin Sets Out-of-Range LTV Values

### Summary

The absence of range validation in [setLtv](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/configuration/ReserveConfiguration.sol#L73-L77) will cause data truncation for protocol users as admin sets LTV values exceeding 16 bits, leading to unintended or corrupted configurations.



### Root Cause

In `ReserveConfiguration.sol`, the lack of range validation for LTV values allows inputs exceeding the 16-bit limit, causing data truncation when these values are bitwise shifted into the configuration.
 When setting the Loan-to-Value (LTV) in `setLtv`, if the provided value exceeds the bit range allocated (16 bits), it can lead to truncation of the LTV value due to the bitmask not preventing larger values from being written.

```solidity
self.data = (self.data & ~LTV_MASK) | ltv;
```
- If `ltv` is greater than `65535` (the max value for 16 bits), it silently truncates to fit, potentially setting an unintended LTV value, leading to incorrect risk calculations and unintended liquidations.

`self.data` alone doesn't help because it merely holds the configuration data as a bitmask without enforcing any constraints on the values being set. Without explicit validation, `self.data` will store whatever value is passed, including out-of-range values that will be **truncated** when bit-shifted into the 16-bit space, leading to **corruption** of the intended configuration.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Admin needs to call `setLtv()` to set ltv to be greater than `65535`.
2. The `self.data` bitmask does not restrict values to the valid 16-bit range.

### External Pre-conditions

1. No external contract or oracle interaction is required.
2. The protocol relies on `self.data` to store and retrieve reserve configuration.

### Attack Path

1. Admin calls `setLtv()` with an `ltv` value greater than `65535`.
2. The `ltv` value is truncated to fit into the 16-bit space without validation.
3. The reserve operates with a corrupted or unintended LTV configuration.

### Impact

The protocol suffers from incorrect risk calculations, which could result in unintended liquidations or improper reserve management, potentially harming users by altering their loan conditions unexpectedly.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a validation check in `setLtv` to ensure `ltv` does not exceed `65535` before applying the bitmask.
