# Griefers can purposefully supply dust values so that bad debt mechanism cannot be triggered.

### Summary
With the V3.3 update, AAVE introduces new logic in regards to bad debt. When a user is getting liquidated, in case they have more outstanding debt, but no more collateral (in base units), all of their debt should be cleared as bad debt (so it does not keep on accruing interest) and in order to account for it, `deficit` accounting is introduced.

```solidity
    // burn bad debt if necessary
    // Each additional debt asset already adds around ~75k gas to the liquidation.
    // To keep the liquidation gas under control, 0 usd collateral positions are not touched, as there is no immediate benefit in burning or transferring to treasury.
    if (hasNoCollateralLeft && userConfig.isBorrowingAny()) {
      _burnBadDebt(reservesData, reservesList, userConfig, params.reservesCount, params.user);
    }
```

For example, let's consider the user has $5,000 in WBTC debt and $4,000 in WETH collateral.
1. Before the user gets liquidated, the griefer can supply 1 wei of USDT and 1 wei of USDC to the to-be-liquidated user. (this can also be done by the liquidator himself)
2. Liquidation happens and user gets liquidated for their entire $4,000 collateral. Due to the donated weis (which are each worth ~100 wei in base asset), bad debt is not cleared. User still has ~$1,000 of WBTC debt
3. If a user wants to liquidate the 1 wei collateral of either of the assets in order to trigger the bad debt logic, they can't. When calculating the corresponding debt that would need to be burned, it would round down to 0 (since USDT: WBTC value are ~1:1000). Variable Debt Tokens revert on 0-value burns and therefore the tx would revert. Bad debt logic cannot be triggered.

```solidity
  function _burnDebtTokens(
    DataTypes.ReserveCache memory debtReserveCache,
    DataTypes.ReserveData storage debtReserve,
    DataTypes.UserConfigurationMap storage userConfig,
    address user,
    address debtAsset,
    uint256 userReserveDebt,
    uint256 actualDebtToLiquidate,
    bool hasNoCollateralLeft
  ) internal {
    // Prior v3.1, there were cases where, after liquidation, the `isBorrowing` flag was left on
    // even after the user debt was fully repaid, so to avoid this function reverting in the `_burnScaled`
    // (see ScaledBalanceTokenBase contract), we check for any debt remaining.
    if (userReserveDebt != 0) {
      debtReserveCache.nextScaledVariableDebt = IVariableDebtToken(
        debtReserveCache.variableDebtTokenAddress
      ).burn(
          user,
          hasNoCollateralLeft ? userReserveDebt : actualDebtToLiquidate,
          debtReserveCache.nextVariableBorrowIndex
        );
    }
```

```solidity
  function _burnScaled(address user, address target, uint256 amount, uint256 index) internal {
    uint256 amountScaled = amount.rayDiv(index);
    require(amountScaled != 0, Errors.INVALID_BURN_AMOUNT);
```

Note: this could be handled by the liquidator donating aTokens to the user. However, this behaviour is unexpected and not documented anywhere, therefore had this issue not been reported, liquidators would not be aware of this mechanic and liquidations would simply fail. It is reasonable to believe by the time the problem is figured out and liquidator acts correctly, the extra accrued yield would exceed 0.01% or $10, which is the requirement for Medium severity.

Issue also breaks the following invariant:
> Create a situation in which a position that should be liquidated can no longer be liquidated


### Root Cause
Protocol attempts to burn 0 debt tokens.


### Impact
Bad debt mechanism cannot be triggered and debt continues to accrue interest.

### Affected Code
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L544

### Mitigation
Do not do 0-value burns.
