# Missing liquidity check in `validateFlashloan` will cause a denial of service for protocol users as malicious actors request excessive flashloans

### **Summary**  
The missing check for sufficient liquidity in `validateFlashloanSimple` will cause **transaction reverts** for **protocol users** as **malicious actors** request flashloans exceeding reserve liquidity.

---

### **Root Cause**  
In ValidationLogic.sol, the [validateFlashloanSimple](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L351-L364) function lacks a check to ensure the requested flashloan amount does not exceed the liquidity held by the reserve’s `aToken`. While the function validates the reserve's active status, paused state, and flashloan enablement, it fails to confirm if the reserve has sufficient balance to execute the loan, leading to downstream transaction failures when liquidity is insufficient.
The check `IERC20(reserve.aTokenAddress).totalSupply() >= amount` is insufficient because `totalSupply` includes both available liquidity and borrowed funds, while flashloans rely solely on the **available liquidity** in the reserve. This means the check could falsely pass even when the reserve does not have enough unborrowed funds, leading to transaction reverts when the flashloan cannot be fulfilled. Instead, the check must use the reserve’s actual balance: `IERC20(reserve.aTokenAddress).balanceOf(address(reserve.aTokenAddress))`.


---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**  
1. A reserve's `aToken` contract holds less liquidity than the flashloan amount requested.  
2. A user or actor calls `validateFlashloan` with `amount > available liquidity`.  

---

### **External Pre-conditions**  
1. There is no external limitation (such as input validation) on the flashloan amount requested by the user.  

---

### **Attack Path**  
1. A malicious actor calls the protocol's `flashLoan` function and requests an excessive amount (greater than the reserve’s available liquidity).  
2. The flashloan proceeds to validation, bypasses `validateFlashloanSimple`, and fails downstream during transfer attempts due to insufficient funds.  
3. The transaction reverts, causing disruption for legitimate users.  

---

### **Impact**  
- **Protocol Impact**: The protocol suffers degraded usability and reliability, as legitimate users face transaction failures.  
- **User Impact**: Users attempting flashloans will experience unnecessary gas loss due to revert behavior caused by an excessive flashloan request.  

---

### **Mitigation**  
Add a liquidity check in `validateFlashloanSimple` to ensure that the flashloan amount does not exceed the reserve's available liquidity:  
```solidity
require(
  IERC20(reserve.underlyingAsset).balanceOf(poolAddress) >= amount,
  Errors.INSUFFICIENT_AVAILABLE_LIQUIDITY
);
```
