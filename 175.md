# Aave v3 aToken Burn Receiver Mismatch Causes Underlying Token Lock During Debt Repayment

## Summary
In Aave v3's debt repayment system, when users repay using aTokens, the underlying tokens remain trapped in the aToken contract due to incorrect handling of the receiver address in the aToken burn operation.

In BorrowLogic.sol, when users repay debt using aTokens, the following code is executed:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L154

```solidity 
if (params.useATokens) {
    IAToken(reserveCache.aTokenAddress).burn(
        msg.sender,
        reserveCache.aTokenAddress,  // WRONG: sends tokens to aToken contract
        paybackAmount,
        reserveCache.nextLiquidityIndex
    );
}
```

Looking at AToken.sol's burn implementation:

```solidity
function burn(
    address from,
    address receiverOfUnderlying,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 index
) external virtual override onlyPool {
    _burnScaled(from, receiverOfUnderlying, amount, index);
    if (receiverOfUnderlying != address(this)) {
        IERC20(_underlyingAsset).safeTransfer(receiverOfUnderlying, amount);
    }
}
```

The issue arises because:
1. The burn function is called with the aToken contract address as receiverOfUnderlying
2. This fails the `receiverOfUnderlying != address(this)` check 
3. As a result, the underlying tokens are never transferred and remain trapped in the aToken contract

## Impact

When users attempt to repay debt using aTokens via the `repayWithATokens()` function, the burn operation only succeeds in destroying the user's aToken balance. However, since the burn's `receiverOfUnderlying` parameter is set to the aToken contract itself, the underlying token transfer is skipped due to the `receiverOfUnderlying != address(this)` check in the burn function. This means that while the aTokens are burned and removed from circulation, the underlying tokens meant for repayment remain immobilized in the aToken contract.

This creates a mismatch between the debt accounting and actual token flows - the protocol registers the debt repayment (by burning aTokens and debt tokens) but never receives the underlying tokens needed to process that repayment. This vulnerability exists in all Aave v3 deployments since it's part of the core repayment logic in the BorrowLogic library.

The issue is observable in any transaction that calls `repayWithATokens()`, which is the primary method for users to repay debt using their aToken holdings rather than the underlying asset.


## Recommendation
Update ExecuteRepayParams struct to include Pool address:

```solidity
struct ExecuteRepayParams {
    address pool;     // Add Pool address
    address asset;
    uint256 amount;
    InterestRateMode interestRateMode; 
    address onBehalfOf;
    bool useATokens;
}
```

Then update the aToken burn call to use Pool address as receiver:

```solidity
if (params.useATokens) {
    IAToken(reserveCache.aTokenAddress).burn(
        msg.sender,
        params.pool,  // Use Pool address as receiver
        paybackAmount, 
        reserveCache.nextLiquidityIndex
    );
}
```

This ensures underlying tokens are properly transferred to the Pool contract to complete the repayment flow.
