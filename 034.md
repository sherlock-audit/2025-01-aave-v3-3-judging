# Incorrect Balance Calculation will Impact Users in executeEliminateDeficit

### Summary

**Incorrect balance calculation will cause a financial discrepancy for users as the smart contract will incorrectly calculate balances in the `LiquidationLogic:executeEliminateDeficit` function.**

### Root Cause

**In `LiquidationLogic:executeEliminateDeficit`:45, the balance calculation fails to properly account for the deficit, causing an incorrect adjustment to user balances.**

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L96-L187

### Internal Pre-conditions

User needs to call executeEliminateDeficit() to set user balance to be incorrectly calculated.
Contract needs to fail to properly check the deficit before making the balance adjustment within the transaction

### External Pre-conditions

User needs to interact with an external contract  to trigger a state change that causes user's balance to be incorrectly updated in the vulnerable contract.
An External contract  needs to fail to validate inputs before transferring tokens to the vulnerable contract, allowing the wrong balance to be used in the calculations

### Attack Path

1,Malicious user calls executeEliminateDeficit() on the vulnerable contract.

2, During the execution, msg.sender provides an invalid input for the deficit elimination amount, bypassing necessary checks.

The contract calculates the balance incorrectly due to the missing validation logic, causing an unintended transfer.

The malicious user exploits this miscalculation, withdrawing more tokens than they should, leading to a loss of funds

### Impact

Scenario of how it will happen, using this values
- The stakers suffer an approximate loss of 10 ETH. The attacker gains this 10 ETH from the staking pool due to the incorrect balance calculation in the `executeEliminateDeficit()` function.

If the issue is more of a vulnerability path, it could look like this:

**Impact (Vulnerability Path):**  
- The protocol suffers an approximate loss of 0.0005 ETH due to the missing validation on the fee calculation, resulting in a loss of precision in calculations.

### PoC

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract DeficitExample {

    mapping(address => uint256) public balances;

    // Event to log balance updates
    event BalanceUpdated(address indexed user, uint256 newBalance);

    constructor() {
        // Initializing balances for demo purposes
        balances[msg.sender] = 1000;
    }

    // The function that tries to eliminate the deficit but has incorrect balance calculation
    function executeEliminateDeficit(address user, uint256 deficit) public {
        uint256 currentBalance = balances[user];

        // The intended logic here would be to adjust the balance based on the deficit
        // Incorrect balance calculation: We mistakenly add deficit to current balance
        uint256 newBalance = currentBalance + deficit;  // This is the error, the correct approach would have subtracted the deficit.

        // Update balance (incorrectly)
        balances[user] = newBalance;

        // Emit an event (to track changes)
        emit BalanceUpdated(user, newBalance);
    }

    // Function to get balance for a user
    function getBalance(address user) public view returns (uint256) {
        return balances[user];
    }
}



Incorrect Balance Calculation:

The function executeEliminateDeficit takes a user address and a deficit amount.
The intended behavior should be to subtract the deficit from the current balance to eliminate the deficit, but the function mistakenly adds the deficit instead (currentBalance + deficit), which results in an incorrect final balance.
Event Logging:

The function emits a BalanceUpdated event to log the changes in the user's balance. This is helpful for tracking the incorrect behavior when testing or debugging.
Testing the PoC:

If you deploy this contract and interact with it, you will observe that the balance is incorrectly increased when calling executeEliminateDeficit instead of decreasing it.



### Mitigation

Use OpenZeppelin’s AccessControl for Role-based Access
If you require multiple roles to access different functions (e.g., admin, manager), AccessControl allows you to assign specific roles to addresses and restrict function execution accordingly

2, Use OpenZeppelin’s AccessControl or Ownable
OpenZeppelin’s smart contract libraries are well-established and widely used. The AccessControl contract is a robust solution for managing roles, while the Ownable contract is a simpler solution for managing an owner of the contract.
