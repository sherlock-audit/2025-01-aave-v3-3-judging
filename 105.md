# Overflow probability when users want to borrow assets in active isolation mode

### Summary

Users can borrow the assets from the protocol with two modes of isolation: active and inactive. If it is in an active mode  the total debt will be updated, and there is a possibility of overflow. 

### Root Cause

If we take a look on the [executeBorrow()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L60) we'll see the the borrow logic execution. Here is a [part](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L109) of the code responsible for checking and updating if the isolation mode is active: 

```solidity
    if (isolationModeActive) {
      uint256 nextIsolationModeTotalDebt = reservesData[isolationModeCollateralAddress]
        .isolationModeTotalDebt += (params.amount /
        10 **
          (reserveCache.reserveConfiguration.getDecimals() -
            ReserveConfiguration.DEBT_CEILING_DECIMALS)).toUint128();
      emit IsolationModeTotalDebtUpdated(
        isolationModeCollateralAddress,
        nextIsolationModeTotalDebt
      );
    }
```

So it will get the current `isolationModeTotalDebt` and sum it with the (`amount` \ `deciamls`). 

The problem liyes in the casting and storage variable update. 

`reservesData[isolationModeCollateralAddress].isolationModeTotalDebt` is a type of `uint128` as we can see in the [DataTypes](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/types/DataTypes.sol#L75) contract.

`params.amount` is a type of `uint256`. 

There may be a case where the result of `amount \ decimal' will still be more than type `uint128'. And the math operation will be:

`uint256 = STORAGE uint128 = uint128 + uint256`

As it is first stored in the storage variable, an overflow may occur and the function will be reversed. 

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users will not be able to borrow assets with active isolation mode.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The whole math operation should be casted to the type of uint128.
