# Improper Handling of Arrays in getReservesList

### **Summary**
The function `getReservesList` improperly handles array operations by assuming that the index `i - droppedReservesCount` is always valid. In cases where `droppedReservesCount > i`, this assumption can lead to an underflow in older Solidity versions or a runtime revert in Solidity >= 0.8.0, potentially causing contract malfunction or crashes.

### **Description**
The issue occurs within the following snippet of code:

```solidity
if (_reservesList[i] != address(0)) {
    reservesList[i - droppedReservesCount] = _reservesList[i];
} else {
    droppedReservesCount++;
}
```

The logic assumes that the index `i - droppedReservesCount` will always be valid. However, if the value of `droppedReservesCount` becomes greater than `i`, the subtraction results in an invalid index:
- In **Solidity versions < 0.8.0**, this would cause an underflow, leading to unintended behavior and potentially incorrect data storage.
- In **Solidity versions >= 0.8.0**, the subtraction will revert due to the introduction of overflow/underflow checks, resulting in the termination of the function execution.

The issue arises because edge cases where `droppedReservesCount > i` are not explicitly handled.

### **Root Cause**
The code assumes that `i - droppedReservesCount` will always be valid without accounting for cases where `droppedReservesCount > i`. This results in unsafe array operations.

**Line of Code (LoC)**:
```solidity
reservesList[i - droppedReservesCount] = _reservesList[i];
```

### **Impact**
If this vulnerability is exploited, the following risks are present:
1. **Malfunction of the contract**: The function may not complete successfully, leading to unexpected behavior or incorrect array manipulation.
2. **Crash of the contract**: In Solidity >= 0.8.0, the function will revert when the invalid index is accessed, causing disruption to the contract's execution flow.



### **Proof of Concept (PoC)**
Consider the following test scenario:
1. `_reservesList` contains an array of 5 elements where only the first element is non-zero.
2. `droppedReservesCount` is incremented with each zero address.
3. When processing the second element (`i = 1`), `droppedReservesCount = 1`, resulting in `1 - 1 = 0`. This is valid.
4. When processing the third element (`i = 2`), if `droppedReservesCount = 3` at that point, `i - droppedReservesCount = 2 - 3 = -1`. This causes:
   - Underflow in Solidity < 0.8.0.
   - Reversion in Solidity >= 0.8.0.

        for (uint256 i = 1; i < reservesList.length - droppedReservesCount; i++) {
            assertEq(reservesList[i], address(0), "Other elements should remain zero");
        }
    }

    function testReversionOnInvalidIndex() public {
        // Simulate a condition where droppedReservesCount > i
        droppedReservesCount = 3;

        vm.expectRevert(); // Expect the function to revert

This will verify both correct handling and edge case reversion for the issue.


### **Recommended Mitigation**
To fix this issue:
1. Use safe array operations that validate indices before assigning values.
2. Explicitly check that `i >= droppedReservesCount` before performing the subtraction. For example:

```solidity
if (_reservesList[i] != address(0)) {
    if (i >= droppedReservesCount) {
        reservesList[i - droppedReservesCount] = _reservesList[i];
    } else {
        // Handle edge case if necessary
    }
} else {
    droppedReservesCount++;
}
```

3. Alternatively, consider rewriting the logic to avoid relying on subtraction entirely. Use an additional index variable to keep track of valid elements instead.
