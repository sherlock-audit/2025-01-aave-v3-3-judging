# Incorrect Handling of `setBorrowing` on First Borrow Allows Permanent Borrowing State Even After Repayment

### Summary  
Failure to properly reset the borrowing state in `userConfig` when the first borrowing is followed by full repayment will cause an incorrect perpetual borrowing state for users as the protocol will incorrectly mark them as borrowers despite having no outstanding debt.

---

### Root Cause  
In BorrowLogic.sol, the `executeBorrow` function sets the borrowing state for a user [as follows](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L105-L107):  

```solidity  
if (isFirstBorrowing) {
    userConfig.setBorrowing(reserve.id, true);
}
```  

However, there is no mechanism in `executeRepay` to reset this state when the user fully repays their debt. This leads to users being marked as borrowers even after they clear all their liabilities, resulting in unintended behavior in other parts of the protocol, such as liquidation checks or borrowing power calculations.

---

### Internal Pre-conditions  
1. **User** performs their first borrowing (`isFirstBorrowing` is `true`).  
2. **User** repays their entire debt through `executeRepay`.  

---

### External Pre-conditions  
1. The debt tokenâ€™s balance (`variableDebt`) for the user reaches zero after repayment.  

---

### Attack Path  
1. **User** borrows for the first time, triggering `userConfig.setBorrowing(reserve.id, true)`.  
2. **User** fully repays their debt, but the borrowing state remains `true`.  
3. The protocol continues to treat the user as a borrower, affecting actions like collateral usage or liquidation status.  

---

### Impact  
The **users** suffer incorrect protocol behavior, such as reduced borrowing power or improper liquidation attempts. The **protocol** risks inefficiencies in handling user states and calculations.  

---

### Mitigation  
Update the `executeRepay` function to reset the borrowing state when the user's debt is fully repaid:  

```solidity  
if (variableDebt - paybackAmount == 0) {
    userConfig.setBorrowing(reserve.id, false);
}
```
