# Potential Denial of Service (DoS) Risk Due to Large Loop Iterations in getAllReservesTokens() and getAllATokens() Functions

### Summary

The functions `getAllReservesTokens()` and `getAllATokens()` are vulnerable to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack when the reserve list (`reserves.length`) is large. Both functions loop over the entire list of reserves, performing external calls inside the loop, which can lead to high gas consumption. This could cause the transaction to fail due to exceeding the block gas limit, especially if the protocol has a large number of reserves.

`getAllReservesTokens()`: This function iterates through all reserves and makes an external call to fetch the token symbol for each reserve.
`getAllATokens()`: Similar to the above, this function iterates through all reserves and makes external calls to fetch the associated aToken symbol.
Both of these functions are susceptible to gas limit issues if the reserve list becomes large, and they may fail to execute under such conditions.

### Root Cause

In both functions, the following code performs external calls inside a loop, which is inefficient for large lists:
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/helpers/AaveProtocolDataProvider.sol#L39-L73

```Solidity
  /// @inheritdoc IPoolDataProvider
  function getAllReservesTokens() external view override returns (TokenData[] memory) {
    IPool pool = IPool(ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.getPool());
    address[] memory reserves = pool.getReservesList();
    TokenData[] memory reservesTokens = new TokenData[](reserves.length);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < reserves.length; i++) {
      if (reserves[i] == MKR) {
        reservesTokens[i] = TokenData({symbol: 'MKR', tokenAddress: reserves[i]});
        continue;
      }
      if (reserves[i] == ETH) {
        reservesTokens[i] = TokenData({symbol: 'ETH', tokenAddress: reserves[i]});
        continue;
      }
      reservesTokens[i] = TokenData({
        symbol: IERC20Detailed(reserves[i]).symbol(),
        tokenAddress: reserves[i]
      });
    }
    return reservesTokens;
  }

  /// @inheritdoc IPoolDataProvider
  function getAllATokens() external view override returns (TokenData[] memory) {
    IPool pool = IPool(ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.getPool());
    address[] memory reserves = pool.getReservesList();
    TokenData[] memory aTokens = new TokenData[](reserves.length);
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < reserves.length; i++) {
      address aTokenAddress = pool.getReserveAToken(reserves[i]);
      aTokens[i] = TokenData({
        symbol: IERC20Detailed(aTokenAddress).symbol(),
        tokenAddress: aTokenAddress
      });
    }
    return aTokens;
  }

```



In both functions:

The loop iterates over all reserves (reserves.length), which can grow significantly.
External calls (IERC20Detailed(reserves[i]).symbol() and IERC20Detailed(aTokenAddress).symbol()) inside the loop consume significant gas, and if the list of reserves is large, this could exceed the block gas limit.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

If the number of reserves increases, the gas consumption of these functions will grow linearly with the number of reserves. This could cause the transaction to exceed the block gas limit, leading to failed transactions.  Even without malicious actors, these functions will become inefficient as the number of reserves grows, making them impractical for large protocols.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

To mitigate the DoS risks and improve scalability:

Limit the Number of Reserves:

Introduce a maximum number of reserves that can be fetched in a single transaction. If the reserve list exceeds this limit, return an error:
Ex:
```Solidity
uint256 maxReserves = 100; // Example threshold
if (reserves.length > maxReserves) {
    revert("Too many reserves");
}
```
