# Unbacked Mint Cap Validation Inconsistent with Economic Calculations

### Description
The `executeMintUnbacked` function in `BridgeLogic.sol` contains a cap validation vulnerability where it enforces the unbacked mint cap against only the `unbacked` amount while ignoring accumulated `deficit`, despite both values contributing to the protocol's total unbacked exposure.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BridgeLogic.sol#L57

```solidity
// In executeMintUnbacked
uint256 unbacked = reserve.unbacked += amount.toUint128();
require(
    unbacked <= unbackedMintCap * (10 ** reserveDecimals),
    Errors.UNBACKED_MINT_CAP_EXCEEDED
);
```

However, the protocol considers both values when calculating rates and risk:
```solidity
calculateInterestRates(
    DataTypes.CalculateInterestRatesParams({
        unbacked: reserve.unbacked + reserve.deficit,  // Total exposure 
        liquidityAdded: liquidityAdded,
        liquidityTaken: liquidityTaken,
        totalDebt: totalVariableDebt,
        // ...
    })
);
```

### Impact
The cap validation inconsistency creates significant risk despite the bridge-only access restriction. A malicious or compromised bridge could:

1. Exploit the gap between tracked and actual exposure to bypass protocol-defined safety limits
2. Mint unbacked tokens beyond intended maximums since `deficit` is excluded from cap checks
3. Cause market disruption through sudden large mints that exceed the true intended cap

This vulnerability is particularly severe because:
- Bridges handle large volumes of cross-chain value
- The unbacked mint cap exists specifically as a critical bridge safety parameter
- Market disruption can occur before interest rate adjustments take effect
- The exposure from unbacked mints directly affects protocol solvency

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1. Align cap validation with total exposure:
```solidity
function executeMintUnbacked(...) {
    uint256 totalExposure = (reserve.unbacked + reserve.deficit) + amount.toUint128();
    require(
        totalExposure <= unbackedMintCap * (10 ** reserveDecimals),
        Errors.UNBACKED_MINT_CAP_EXCEEDED
    );
    // ...
}
```

2. Consider separate tracking of unbacked vs deficit exposure:
```solidity
require(
    reserve.unbacked + amount <= unbackedMintCap * (10 ** reserveDecimals),
    Errors.UNBACKED_MINT_CAP_EXCEEDED
);
require(
    reserve.deficit <= maxDeficitCap,
    Errors.DEFICIT_CAP_EXCEEDED  
);
```

These changes ensure the protocol's safety parameters properly account for all forms of unbacked exposure.
