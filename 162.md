# Liquidators will fail to liquidate if the total debt is capped and leftover is dust

### Summary

When liquidators do a liquidation, if the collateral and debt balance exceed the threshold, the maximum liquidatable debt will be capped. Additionally, the remaining debt cannot be less than a predetermined dust amount. In some scenarios, both conditions can occur, leading to the liquidation reverting.

### Root Cause

When liquidation occurs, if the total collateral and debt exceed the predetermined `MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD`, the maximum amount to be liquidated will be capped as follows:

There is another check that ensures the user's remaining reserve debt and collateral balance are not dust:  
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L325-L345  

In some scenarios, the debt may be capped, and as a result, the maximum liquidatable debt could be lower than the amount the liquidator intends to repay. However, after repaying this capped debt amount, the remaining debt could be less than the predetermined `MIN_LEFTOVER_BASE`, causing the liquidation to revert.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User has debt and collateral amount more than `MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD` in base currency units
2. Capped liquidation amount would leave users collateral or debt balance smaller than `MIN_LEFTOVER_BASE`

### External Pre-conditions

None needed

### Attack Path

No attack path, can happen naturally if the balances fits the above described scenario. Someone can specifically supply and borrow to satisfy these conditions to delay their liquidations and take advantage of not being able to be liquidated.

### Impact

Liquidatiors will fail to liquidate a user that is indeed eligible to be liquidated. Result of it will be a delayed liquidation which can occur bad debt. 

### PoC

```solidity
function test_liq_impossible_due_to_dust() public {
    uint256 amount = 2100e6;
    uint256 borrowAmount = 1990e6;

    vm.startPrank(poolAdmin);
    contracts.poolConfiguratorProxy.configureReserveAsCollateral(
      tokenList.usdx,
      9500, // LTV = 95%
      9600, // Liquidation Threshold = 98%
      10400 // Liquidation Bonus = 105%
    );
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.startPrank(Alice);
    contracts.poolProxy.supply(tokenList.usdx, amount, alice, 0);
    contracts.poolProxy.borrow(tokenList.usdx, borrowAmount, 2, 0, Alice);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // accrue interest such that the account is liquidatable
    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 13600 days);

    // Get user account data, print stuff 
    (
        uint256 totalCollateralBase,
        uint256 totalDebtBase,
        uint256 availableBorrowsBase,
        uint256 currentLiquidationThreshold,
        uint256 ltv,
        uint256 healthFactor
    ) = contracts.poolProxy.getUserAccountData(Alice);

    console.log("Total Collateral (Base):", totalCollateralBase);
    console.log("Total Debt (Base):", totalDebtBase);
    console.log("Available Borrows:", availableBorrowsBase);
    console.log("Current Liquidation Threshold:", currentLiquidationThreshold);
    console.log("LTV:", ltv);
    console.log("Health Factor:", healthFactor);

    LiquidationInput memory params = _loadLiquidationInput(
      alice,
      tokenList.usdx,
      tokenList.usdx,
      UINT256_MAX,
      tokenList.wbtc,
      0
    );

    // user is indeed liquidatable!
    bool isLiquidatable = healthFactor < 1e18;
    assert(isLiquidatable);

    // Liquidate 
    vm.prank(bob);
    vm.expectRevert(bytes(Errors.MUST_NOT_LEAVE_DUST)); // we revert here cant liq the user!
    contracts.poolProxy.liquidationCall(
      params.collateralAsset,
      params.debtAsset,
      params.user,
      params.liquidationAmountInput,
      params.receiveAToken
    );
  }
```

### Mitigation

If the capped debt amount (maxLiquidatableDebt) will make the users collateral or debt balance lower than the dust amount, then increase the maxLiquidatableDebt such that user will be liquidated and there will not be a dust. This would lead `maxLiquidatableDebt` to be slightly higher assuming the predetermined dust amount is small enough which would be a considerable liquidation for liquidators.
