# Incorrect Liquidation Condition Enforcement leading to breaking of invariant and wrong liquidation.

### Summary

The liquidation logic in the [executeLiquidationCall](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L279C5-L290C9) function fails to properly enforce the conditions for determining the maxLiquidatableDebt. Specifically, the condition combining health factor thresholds and debt/collateral checks uses a logical AND (&&) instead of a logical OR (||). This inconsistency causes some unhealthy positions to avoid full liquidation or to be partially liquidated when they should be fully liquidated.

The current conditions for full liquidation implemented in the code:
```solidity
/ by default whole debt in the reserve could be liquidated
    uint256 maxLiquidatableDebt = vars.userReserveDebt;
    // but if debt and collateral is above or equal MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD
    // and health factor is above CLOSE_FACTOR_HF_THRESHOLD this amount may be adjusted
    if (
      vars.userReserveCollateralInBaseCurrency >= MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD &&
      vars.userReserveDebtInBaseCurrency >= MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD &&
      vars.healthFactor > CLOSE_FACTOR_HF_THRESHOLD
    ) {
      uint256 totalDefaultLiquidatableDebtInBaseCurrency = vars.totalDebtInBaseCurrency.percentMul(
        DEFAULT_LIQUIDATION_CLOSE_FACTOR
      );
```
It goes against the invariant in aave v3.3 properties.md which says;

There are certain mutually inclusive conditions which increases the CLOSE_FACTOR to 100%:
When a users health-factor drops <=0.95 **or**
if the users total value of the debt position to be liquidated is below MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD
if the users total value of the collateral position to be liquidated is below MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD.

The emphasis is on the **OR** used in the invariant above. So the condition should check if the health factor <= 0.95 OR collateral is below MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD before the entire position can be liquidated. 
As we can see, this was violated due to the use of && (i.e && vars.healthFactor > CLOSE_FACTOR_HF_THRESHOLD) instead of ||. This leads to the breaking of the invariant and a situation where some unhealthy positions will not be liquidated when the health factor drops <= 0.95 but the collateral and debt is above MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD which may cause insolvency.

### Root Cause

In LiquidationLogic.sol: 283-286, The issue lies in the following condition within the code:

```solidity
if (
  vars.userReserveCollateralInBaseCurrency >= MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD &&
  vars.userReserveDebtInBaseCurrency >= MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD &&
  vars.healthFactor > CLOSE_FACTOR_HF_THRESHOLD
)
```

This condition requires all three sub-conditions to be true before adjusting the maxLiquidatableDebt. However, the liquidation logic adjustment should apply **when the collateral/debt is above or equal to MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD OR when the health factor is above the CLOSE_FACTOR_HF_THRESHOLD.**

This in line with the invariant in properties.md that says; 

There are certain mutually inclusive conditions which increases the CLOSE_FACTOR to 100%:

- when a users health-factor drops <=0.95 **or**
- if the users total value of the debt position to be liquidated is below MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD
- if the users total value of the collateral position to be liquidated is below MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD


To be certain, I also asked the sponsor and the Sherlock judge what the statement means and how the liquidation logic should work, HERE IS THE REPLY I GOT:

**The requirements for the liquidation are if the health factor is < 1 and > 0.95, then we can liquidate up to 50% of the position. If the health factor <= 0.95 OR collateral is below MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD, then the entire position can be liquidated**

This further confirms that the current implementation goes against the expected logic flow thereby breaking the invariant and leading to scenarios where unhealthy positions will not be liquidated completely when the health factor drops <= 0.95 but the collateral and debt is above MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD which may cause insolvency.

### Internal Pre-conditions

The liquidation logic strictly enforces the combination of all three conditions (&&)

### External Pre-conditions

A user has a health factor (HF) â‰¤ 0.95, and their debt-to-collateral ratio is at above or equal to thresholds defined by MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD

### Attack Path

 1. A borrower with a dangerously low health factor (e.g., 0.90) and collateral/debt above or equal thresholds could avoid partial liquidation due to the incorrect enforcement of all three conditions.
 2. Such positions could persist until fully under-collateralized, exposing the protocol to bad debt during extreme market volatility.
 3. Exploitive users could deliberately leverage the flaw to maintain risky positions longer, increasing the likelihood of systemic risks to the protocol.

The protocol should allow liquidation because the health factor is below the threshold, regardless of the debt/collateral thresholds.

### Impact

1. Breaks the invariant
2. Unhealthy positions can persist longer, leading to increased exposure to bad debt which will cause protocol insolvency

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Modify the condition in the executeLiquidationCall function to use logical OR (||) instead of AND (&&), ensuring proper enforcement of liquidation thresholds:

```solidity
if (
  vars.userReserveCollateralInBaseCurrency >= MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD &&
  vars.userReserveDebtInBaseCurrency >= MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD 
  || vars.healthFactor > CLOSE_FACTOR_HF_THRESHOLD
) {
  uint256 totalDefaultLiquidatableDebtInBaseCurrency = vars.totalDebtInBaseCurrency.percentMul(
    DEFAULT_LIQUIDATION_CLOSE_FACTOR
  );
}
```
