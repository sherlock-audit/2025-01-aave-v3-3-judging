# Missing Authorization Check for Borrowing on Behalf of onBehalfOf Address

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L103

Unauthorized Borrowing: A user can designate an address as the `onBehalfOf` party and invoke the `executeBorrow` function in a credit delegation scenario. If the specified `onBehalfOf` address has not explicitly authorized the user to borrow using their credit, the `onBehalfOf` party incurs the debt while the user receives the borrowed funds.

In a credit delegation scenario, the user (delegatee) can assign responsibility for the debt to an `onBehalfOf` address via the `executeBorrow` function. However, there is no mechanism to verify that the `onBehalfOf` address has authorized the user to borrow on their behalf, as outlined in the `mint` function documentation.


### Attack Path

1. Bob unknowingly becomes the onBehalfOf party.
2. Alice maliciously calls the borrow function, passing her address as user and Bob’s address as onBehalfOf.
3. If the protocol doesn’t validate that Bob has explicitly allowed Alice to borrow using his credit, Bob ends up with the debt, while Alice receives the funds.

### Impact

Assignment of debt to the `onBehalfOf` address without their explicit authorization.


### Mitigation

Implement proper access control and ensure that the onBehalfOf address has explicitly granted permission to the user through a signed message before the `mint` function is called
