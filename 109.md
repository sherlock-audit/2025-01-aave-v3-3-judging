# User can be completely liquidated with health above 0.95

### Summary

There is an edge case when a user with a healthFactor over 0.95 can be 100% liquidated with two attacer transactions. 

### Root Cause

Base on a protocol properties there is a system for position liquidations: 

1. if a healthFactor drops below `1` a 50% of a position can be liquidated, 
2. and it it drops below 0.95 a 100% of a position can be liquidated.

There is a special validation [check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L283) to fing out if a position it below 0.95:

```solidity
    // by default whole debt in the reserve could be liquidated
    uint256 maxLiquidatableDebt = vars.userReserveDebt;

    // but if debt and collateral is above or equal MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD
    // and health factor is above CLOSE_FACTOR_HF_THRESHOLD this amount may be adjusted

    if (
      vars.userReserveCollateralInBaseCurrency >= MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD &&
      vars.userReserveDebtInBaseCurrency >= MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD &&
      vars.healthFactor > CLOSE_FACTOR_HF_THRESHOLD
    ) {
      uint256 totalDefaultLiquidatableDebtInBaseCurrency = vars.totalDebtInBaseCurrency.percentMul(
        DEFAULT_LIQUIDATION_CLOSE_FACTOR
      );
```

So if healthFactor is more than 0.95 and collateral/debt amount more than MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD (2000e8) only 50% of position can be liquidated:

```solidity
 /**
   * @dev Default percentage of borrower's debt to be repaid in a liquidation.
   * @dev Percentage applied when the users health factor is above `CLOSE_FACTOR_HF_THRESHOLD`
   * Expressed in bps, a value of 0.5e4 results in 50.00%
   */
  uint256 internal constant DEFAULT_LIQUIDATION_CLOSE_FACTOR = 0.5e4;
```

So I guess it is a chance for a user to add more collateral and increase the healthFactor to prevent any liquidation. 

However, this check can be bypassed with multiple function calls in the same transaction by the attacker to liquidate the 100% of the poisition evenn if the current healthFactor is over 0.95.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. 1. The attacker sees the desired debt position fall below HealthFactor 1, but it is still above 0.95;
2.  He creates the transaction call with several liquidation calls in it. 
3. Each time a liquidation occurs, the attacker receives a portion of the user's collateral position plus a bonus. 
4. The balance of collateral/debt changes: there will be more debt tokens than collateral tokens;
5. Due to imbalance and liquidation: two situations can occur: 1. healthFactor falls below 0.95, 2. user collateral balance falls below MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD.
6. Attacker receives 100% of liquidation position

### Impact

A user can be 100% liquidated even with a HealthFactor slightly below 1.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider adding a reentrancy guard to prevent multiple calls to the liquidation function.
