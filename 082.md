# Stale Interest Rate Index Allows Borrow Cap Violations

### **Summary**  
A failure to account for **interest rate accruals on variable debt** will cause **borrow cap violations** for the **protocol** as the total debt calculation underestimates the true borrow balance, allowing users to exceed the configured borrow cap.  

---

### **Root Cause**  
In `ValidationLogic.validateBorrow`, the total borrow balance (`vars.totalDebt`) is [computed as](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L181-L185):  
```solidity
vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt = params.reserveCache.currScaledVariableDebt.rayMul(
    params.reserveCache.nextVariableBorrowIndex
);
vars.totalDebt = vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt + params.amount;
```
The root cause lies in the dependency on the `nextVariableBorrowIndex` to accurately reflect accrued interest when performing the borrow cap validation. If the index is **not updated** prior to the borrow validation due to a missed or skipped update (e.g. another function partially executed but didn't finalize the reserve's state), the protocol underestimates the current debt.

In `ValidationLogic.validateBorrow`, the calculation:  
```solidity
vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt = params.reserveCache.currScaledVariableDebt.rayMul(
    params.reserveCache.nextVariableBorrowIndex
);
```
relies on `nextVariableBorrowIndex` being **up-to-date** with accrued interest. However:  
1. If a state-changing action (e.g., repay or flash loan) **fails to update the index**, the protocol uses stale values.
2. This results in an **underestimation of `vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt`**, bypassing the borrow cap checks.  
3. Borrowers can continue borrowing even when the **true total debt** exceeds the configured borrow cap.  

This issue can occur due to race conditions, skipped updates, or execution sequences where the index isn't updated in time.

### **Internal Pre-conditions**  
1. **Protocol Admin** needs to set a **non-zero borrow cap** for a reserve.  
2. **Borrow Reserve Index Update** is not triggered due to missed or delayed state updates.  

---

### **External Pre-conditions**  
1. Borrow transactions must occur across multiple blocks without an intermediate **reserve index update**.  
2. Borrow cap utilization is near the configured maximum.  

---

### **Attack Path**  
1. **User A** borrows from a reserve with a non-zero borrow cap, incrementing the variable debt.  
2. **User B** borrows before the **nextVariableBorrowIndex** is updated to reflect accumulated interest on previous borrowings.  
3. The borrow cap is violated as the protocol approves the borrow without correctly calculating the **true total debt** (due to underestimated accrual).  

---

### **Impact**  
The **protocol** suffers a breach of its borrow cap policy, which may lead to **liquidity exhaustion** in the reserve. This can destabilize lending operations and increase insolvency risks.  

---

### **Mitigation**  
Enforce a proactive update to `nextVariableBorrowIndex` in all functions impacting the borrow state before computing `vars.totalDebt`.
