# Incorrect LTV validation in `validateHFAndLtv` will cause improper collateral assessment for users, leading to invalid rejections

### **Summary**  
The reliance on **zero-LTV collateral** checks in `validateHFAndLtv` will cause **unintended rejections of valid user actions** for **users** when **collateral assets with non-zero LTV are incorrectly flagged** due to a mismatch in collateral and reserve configuration.

---

### **Root Cause**  
In `ValidationLogic.sol`, the `validateHFAndLtv` function assumes that collateral with zero LTV (Loan-to-Value) cannot coexist with reserves having non-zero LTV configurations. [Specifically, the check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L507-L510):

```solidity
require(
    !hasZeroLtvCollateral || reserve.configuration.getLtv() == 0,
    Errors.LTV_VALIDATION_FAILED
);
```

fails to account for cases where users may hold valid non-zero LTV reserves alongside zero-LTV assets. This causes actions like borrowing or withdrawing to be incorrectly flagged as invalid if any collateral in the user's portfolio has a zero LTV, rather than evaluating the portfolio as a whole.

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**  
1. A reserve with non-zero LTV exists in the system.  
2. A user holds collateral marked as zero-LTV due to specific configuration but attempts an action requiring reserve LTV validation.  

---

### **External Pre-conditions**  
1. The oracle must report correct prices for the user’s collateral and debt assets.  
2. Protocol configurations do not disable zero-LTV reserves by design.

---

### **Attack Path**  
1. A user supplies collateral with a non-zero LTV reserve but with zero-LTV configuration on the user side.  
2. The protocol incorrectly flags the user's position as invalid due to the `validateHFAndLtv` zero-LTV check.  
3. Actions such as borrowing, withdrawing, or repaying are incorrectly rejected.

---

### **Impact**  
Users cannot borrow or use their collateral properly despite meeting all other reserve requirements, leading to unnecessary. 

---

### **Mitigation**  
Refactor `validateHFAndLtv` to ensure that zero-LTV collateral is only flagged if **all** reserves in the user’s portfolio are zero-LTV, and actions dependent on LTV are explicitly checked against valid reserves.
