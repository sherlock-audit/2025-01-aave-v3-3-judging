# Health Factor recalculation delay allows liquidators to over-liquidate users.

### **Summary**  
The delayed health factor recalculation in `executeLiquidationCall` allows liquidators to over-liquidate users, especially in scenarios involving multiple liquidations in a single block or gas-efficient batching systems.

---

### **Root Cause**  
In `LiquidationLogic.sol` (within [executeLiquidationCall](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L215-L251)), the user's health factor is not recalculated after each liquidation. As a result, if multiple liquidators act on the same user in rapid succession (e.g., during a high-stress market event), the user’s position can be over-liquidated.

### **Internal Pre-conditions**  
1. A user's health factor is initially below `1`, making them eligible for liquidation.  
2. Multiple liquidators submit liquidation transactions within the same block or immediately after one another.  
3. The user has sufficient collateral for over-liquidation.

---

### **External Pre-conditions**  
None (assumes the protocol is under high market activity or stress).

---

### **Attack Path**  
1. A user’s position becomes liquidatable (health factor < 1).  
2. Liquidator A submits a transaction to liquidate part of the user's debt.  
3. Before the transaction is mined and the user's health factor is updated, Liquidator B also submits a liquidation transaction, assuming the original health factor.  
4. Both transactions succeed, resulting in the user’s position being over-liquidated.

---

### **Impact**  
The protocol allows **over-liquidation of user positions**, potentially reducing the collateral left for the user and transferring excess collateral to liquidators. This damages user trust and exposes the protocol to legal or reputational risks.

---

### **Mitigation**  
Recalculate and enforce the health factor after each liquidation to ensure no additional liquidations occur once the health factor recovers above the threshold.
