# Interest Rate Manipulation Risk Through Flash Loan-Enabled Utilization Attacks

## Summary
The Aave v3 borrowing mechanism is vulnerable to flash loan attacks that can manipulate interest rates by rapidly changing utilization ratios. While protections exist, the system lacks explicit safeguards against rapid utilization changes that could impact borrowing costs.

## Vulnerability Details
In BorrowLogic.sol, the borrowing flow updates interest rates based on utilization:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L60

```solidity
// Initial state update
reserve.updateState(reserveCache);

// Interest rate update after borrow
reserve.updateInterestRatesAndVirtualBalance(
  reserveCache,
  params.asset,
  0, // liquidityAdded 
  params.releaseUnderlying ? params.amount : 0  // liquidityTaken
);
```

The vulnerability arises because:

1. `updateState()` only updates indices based on previous rates
2. `updateInterestRatesAndVirtualBalance()` calculates new rates based on current utilization:
```solidity
uint256 totalVariableDebt = reserveCache.nextScaledVariableDebt.rayMul(
  reserveCache.nextVariableBorrowIndex
);
(uint256 nextLiquidityRate, uint256 nextVariableRate) = IReserveInterestRateStrategy(
  reserve.interestRateStrategyAddress
).calculateInterestRates(...);
```

## Attack Path
1. Attacker uses flash loan to make large deposit, lowering utilization and rates
2. Other users borrow at artificially low rates 
3. Attacker quickly withdraws deposit and borrows heavily to spike utilization
4. Interest rates increase rapidly based on new utilization

## Impact

The interest rate manipulation can directly affect borrower positions through unplanned rate increases driven by rapid utilization changes. When an attacker executes large deposits followed by withdrawals, the protocol's interest rate calculations in `updateInterestRatesAndVirtualBalance()` respond to these utilization shifts, causing rate volatility. Since borrowers' variable debt accrual is tied to these rates through `variableBorrowIndex`, sudden rate spikes increase their debt faster than anticipated.

While the attack requires careful timing and substantial capital to influence utilization meaningfully, the impact manifests through the protocol's own interest rate mechanics rather than external factors. The effectiveness depends on market depth and current utilization levels, as deeper liquidity pools require more capital to manipulate. However, in periods of lower liquidity, even moderate-sized flash loans could trigger notable rate movements through the `calculateInterestRates()` function's response to utilization changes.

This creates a reproducible exploit path where rate volatility is achieved through legitimate protocol functions, potentially destabilizing borrowing positions that were opened under different rate assumptions. The lack of rate change limits or circuit breakers in the current implementation means these rate movements, once triggered, directly impact all variable-rate borrowers in the affected market.

## Proof of Concept
An attacker could:
1. Flash loan 10M USDC
2. Deposit to lower utilization from 80% to 40%
3. Wait for borrowers to act on lower rates
4. Withdraw and borrow to push utilization back to 80%+
5. Repay flash loan

## Recommendation
1. Implement rate change limits between blocks
2. Add circuit breakers for utilization swings
3. Consider historical rate checks
4. Add slippage protection for borrowers

For example:
```solidity
function executeBorrow(...) {
    // Add max rate change per block
    require(
        newRate <= prevRate * MAX_RATE_CHANGE,
        "Rate change too large"
    );
    
    // Add utilization change limits
    require(
        newUtilization <= prevUtilization * MAX_UTIL_CHANGE,
        "Utilization change too large"
    );
}
```
