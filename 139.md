# attacker can make 'withdrawETHWithPermit'  fail

### Summary

When a user calls `withdrawETHWithPermit` function, attacker can make the call revert by front-running. This happens because of a missing `try-catch` statement in the `withdrawETHWithPermit` function.


### Root Cause

When ` withdrawETHWithPermit` is called, by passing a permit signature, the contract calls the `permit` function of the asset to get approval to spend on behalf of caller. It then calls the `Pool.withdraw` function to withdraw the ETH.

```solidity
aWETH.permit(msg.sender, address(this), amount, deadline, permitV, permitR, permitS); //@audit Attacker can grief a user by making  'withdrawETHWithPermit' call fail

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1.user call `withdrawETHWithPermit` to withdraw ETH
2.attacker make the call revert by front-running


### Impact

Attacker can grief users by frontrunning the `withdrawETHWithPermit` functions, making that functionality unusable by users


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Implement a try-catch statement. Inside the `withdrawETHWithPermit` function, call the assets `permit` statement using a try statement, and catch any revert. That will resolve the issue.
