# Protocol can be made to lose out on liquidation fees all the time.

### Summary

Users being liquidated can reduce their collateral balance to 0.. Whenever collateral Balance = 0. calculation for liquidation fee results in 0

### Root Cause

Checking `LiquidationLogic._calculateAvailableCollateralToLiquidate()` which is used to calculate `liquidationProtocolFee` amongst other things. 

```solidity
 if (vars.maxCollateralToLiquidate > userCollateralBalance) {
      vars.collateralAmount = userCollateralBalance;
      vars.debtAmountNeeded = ((vars.collateralAssetPrice * vars.collateralAmount * debtAssetUnit) /
        (debtAssetPrice * collateralAssetUnit)).percentDiv(liquidationBonus);
    } else {
      vars.collateralAmount = vars.maxCollateralToLiquidate;
      vars.debtAmountNeeded = debtToCover;
    }

    vars.collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency =
      (vars.collateralAmount * vars.collateralAssetPrice) /
      collateralAssetUnit;

    if (vars.liquidationProtocolFeePercentage != 0) {
      vars.bonusCollateral =
        vars.collateralAmount -
        vars.collateralAmount.percentDiv(liquidationBonus);

      vars.liquidationProtocolFee = vars.bonusCollateral.percentMul(
        vars.liquidationProtocolFeePercentage
      );
      vars.collateralAmount -= vars.liquidationProtocolFee;
    }
    return (
      vars.collateralAmount,
      vars.debtAmountNeeded,
      vars.liquidationProtocolFee,
      vars.collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency
    );
  }
```

It is observed that if `userCollateralBalance` == 0 , the calculation for so many things of which `liquidationProtocolFee` is among will result in 0.

So whenever a user deliberately reduces his collateral to 0 especially when he knows that he is about to be liquidated, Protocol will lose out on liquidation fees.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. calculation for liquidationProtocolFee relies on user-to-be-liquidated's collateral balance.

### External Pre-conditions

1. user reduces his collateral to 0 when his position is liquidatable

### Attack Path

1. User takes positions 
2. user's position turns unhealthy and becomes liquidatable
3. user transfers out all his collateral balance reducing it to 0
4. user's position is liquidated but protocol loses out on liquidation fees.

### Impact

Protocol can be made to lose out on liquidation fees all the time.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Use a locking system for user's collaterals.

That way in situations of liquidation, there's no risk that the user can deliberately reduce his collateral balance to 0.

Using a locking system for user's collateral will ensure that liquidator's will receive incentives most times and protocol won't be made to lose out on fees deliberately by malicious users
