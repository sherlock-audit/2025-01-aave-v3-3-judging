# Attacker can cause protocol insolvency through flash loan manipulation

### Summary

Ignoring reserve state flags will cause protocol insolvency for depositors as attackers will exploit incorrect reserve state readings through flash loan manipulation


### Root Cause

In src/contracts/helpers/AaveProtocolDataProvider.sol#101 (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/helpers/AaveProtocolDataProvider.sol#L101) the ignored flag values from `getFlags()` can lead to incorrect reserve state assessment during flash loans




### Internal Pre-conditions

1. The reserve needs to be active with flash loan capability
2. The configuration flags must be incorrectly read due to ignored return values
3. Flash loan fee calculation must depend on proper flag reading


### External Pre-conditions

Large liquidity available in connected DeFi protocols for arbitrage

### Attack Path

1. Attacker deploys exploit contract monitoring flag mismatches
2. When flags are misread:
   a. Attacker initiates multiple flash loans with incorrect fee calculations
   b. Exploits the price differences in connected protocols
   c. Returns loans with minimal fees due to incorrect state reading
3. Protocol accumulates losses from missed fees
4. Attacker repeats across multiple assets

### Impact

1. The protocol loses significant revenue from flash loan fees, estimated 100% of expected flash loan fees
2. Liquidity providers receive reduced yields
3. Protocol's flash loan mechanism becomes economically unviable

    }
}
```

### Mitigation

1. Properly handle all return values from `configuration.getFlags()`
2. Implement additional validation layers for flash loan fee calculations
3. Add circuit breakers for unusual flash loan patterns
4. Regular auditing of flash loan fee accumulation
