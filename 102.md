# rounding when calculating debtneeded causes loss for the protocol

### Summary

DebtNeeded rounds down the calculation when collateral to liquidate exceeds user's balance.

When calculating the debt, if the collateral to liquidate exceeds the user's balance, the liquidator receives the total collateral balance of the borrower. The debt amount the liquidator will repay is recalculated, but the calculation rounds down the debt repayment amount. This is problematic because after the liquidation, the full collateral will be liquidated while leaving some debt due to the rounding. This remaining debt is directly added to the reserve deficit, causing the protocol to take the loss since it's added to the deficit.


 When collateral exceeds user balance:

    if (vars.maxCollateralToLiquidate > userCollateralBalance) {
      vars.collateralAmount = userCollateralBalance;
      vars.debtAmountNeeded = ((vars.collateralAssetPrice * vars.collateralAmount * debtAssetUnit) /
        (debtAssetPrice * collateralAssetUnit)).percentDiv(liquidationBonus);

The rounding down in this calculation means:
Liquidator pays slightly less debt
Gets full collateral amount
Difference becomes bad debt
Added to reserve deficit
This directly conflicts with protocol goals:
Avoiding dust/bad debt buildup
Preventing loss of funds caused by liquidations

### Internal Pre-conditions

collateral exceeds borrowers balance

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Each liquidation could create small amounts of bad debt
Accumulates over time
Protocol bears the loss

### PoC

User has 1 ETH collateral
ETH price: $2000
USDC price: $1
Liquidation bonus: 110%

debtAmountNeeded = ((2000e8 * 1e18 * 1e6) / (1e8 * 1e18)).percentDiv(11000)

1. 2000e8 * 1e18 = 2000e26
2. * 1e6 = 2000e32
3. / 1e8 = 2000e24
4. / 1e18 = 2000e6
5. percentDiv(2000e6, 11000):
   (2000e6 * 10000) / 11000 = 1818.181818...e6
   Rounds down to 1818e6 USDC


Result:

Liquidator pays: 1,818 USDC
Gets: 1 ETH worth 2,000 USD
Protocol loss: 0.181818... USDC per liquidation

Impact at scale:
100 such liquidations = 18.18 USDC loss
1000 liquidations = 181.81 USDC loss

loss per liquidation for the protocol

Expected repayment = 1818.181818... USDC
Actual repayment = 1818.000000 USDC
Loss = 0.181818... USDC

Loss percentage calculation:
(0.181818... / 1818.181818...) * 100
= 0.0001 * 100
= 0.01%
this makes this issue valid according to sherlock rules
