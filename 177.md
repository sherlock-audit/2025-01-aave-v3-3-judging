# Unbounded Bridge Fees in Token Backing Can Manipulate Pool Economics

### Description
In `BridgeLogic.sol`, the `executeBackUnbacked` function lacks validation between backing amounts and their associated fees, allowing bridges to manipulate pool economics through disproportionate fees. While this can only be executed by authorized bridges, it represents a meaningful protocol risk.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BridgeLogic.sol#L121

```solidity
function executeBackUnbacked(
    DataTypes.ReserveData storage reserve,
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 fee,
    uint256 protocolFeeBps
) external returns (uint256) {
    uint256 backingAmount = (amount < reserve.unbacked) ? amount : reserve.unbacked;
    uint256 feeToProtocol = fee.percentMul(protocolFeeBps);
    uint256 feeToLP = fee - feeToProtocol;
    uint256 added = backingAmount + fee;
    // No validation of fee relative to backingAmount
```

The key vulnerability is that fees can be disproportionately large compared to the actual backing amount, which impacts core protocol metrics through the liquidity index calculation:

```solidity
reserveCache.nextLiquidityIndex = reserve.cumulateToLiquidityIndex(
    IERC20(reserveCache.aTokenAddress).totalSupply() +
    uint256(reserve.accruedToTreasury).rayMul(reserveCache.nextLiquidityIndex),
    feeToLP
);
```

### Impact

The severity of this issue stems from how bridge-provided fees directly influence core pool parameters. When a bridge submits excessive fees relative to small backing amounts, it triggers a sequence of economic distortions:

First, it artificially inflates the liquidity index through the LP fee distribution:
```solidity
reserveCache.nextLiquidityIndex = reserve.cumulateToLiquidityIndex(
    IERC20(reserveCache.aTokenAddress).totalSupply() +
    uint256(reserve.accruedToTreasury).rayMul(reserveCache.nextLiquidityIndex),
    feeToLP
);
```
This inflated liquidity index cascades into aToken exchange rates since they derive their value from this index, affecting all users holding aTokens in the pool.

The protocol portion of these fees then accumulates in treasury at an accelerated rate:
```solidity
reserve.accruedToTreasury += feeToProtocol.rayDiv(
    reserveCache.nextLiquidityIndex
).toUint128();
```

Finally, these artificial liquidity additions influence the interest rate model's calculations:
```solidity
reserve.updateInterestRatesAndVirtualBalance(
    reserveCache,
    asset, 
    added,  // backingAmount + inflated fee
    0
);
```
Since `added` includes both the backing amount and fee, disproportionate fees can trigger unwarranted interest rate adjustments across the pool.

While this manipulation requires bridge authorization and actual token transfers:
```solidity
IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, reserveCache.aTokenAddress, added);
```
A compromised bridge could still exploit this to create significant economic distortions. For example, a bridge could back 100 USDC of unbacked debt while providing 10,000 USDC in fees, causing artificial rate spikes and skewed aToken valuations that affect all pool participants.


### Recommended Mitigation Steps
1. Implement fee validation relative to backing amount:
```solidity
uint256 backingAmount = (amount < reserve.unbacked) ? amount : reserve.unbacked;
require(fee <= backingAmount.percentMul(MAX_BACKING_FEE_BPS), "Bridge fee too large");
```

2. Add protocol-level fee caps for bridge operations:
```solidity
uint256 constant MAX_BACKING_FEE_BPS = 1000; // 10% 
uint256 constant MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS = 5000; // 50% of total fee
require(protocolFeeBps <= MAX_PROTOCOL_FEE_BPS, "Protocol fee too high");
```

3. Consider implementing tiered fee caps based on backing amounts:
```solidity
function getMaxFee(uint256 backingAmount) internal pure returns (uint256) {
    if (backingAmount <= SMALL_BACKING_THRESHOLD) {
        return backingAmount.percentMul(MAX_SMALL_BACKING_FEE_BPS);
    }
    return backingAmount.percentMul(MAX_BACKING_FEE_BPS);
}
```

These changes protect against economic manipulation while maintaining bridge functionality within reasonable bounds.
