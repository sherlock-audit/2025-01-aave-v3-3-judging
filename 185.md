# Unauthorized Access to Deficit Elimination Logic Bypasses Umbrella Entity Control

### Summary

Some of the invariant in properties.md specifies that:

- The burning of claims can only be performed by a permissioned UMBRELLA entity registered on the PoolAddressesProvider
- Claims can only be burned trough pool.eliminateReserveDeficit() up to the current obligations stored in reserve.deficit.

However, the function [executeEliminateDeficit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L96) called through pool.eliminateReserveDeficit(), which is responsible for eliminating a reserve's deficit, is externally callable, allowing unauthorized contracts to bypass the access control enforced by the onlyUmbrella modifier in pool.eliminateReserveDeficit(). This causes a critical vulnerability, where the burning of claims — a key process in managing the protocol's financial health — can be exploited by an unauthorized entity, violating the main invariant that only the permissioned Umbrella entity should be able to perform these actions and causing financial loss.


### Root Cause

The core logic for deficit elimination is found in the function [executeEliminateDeficit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L96), which is marked as external. While this function is meant to be restricted by the onlyUmbrella modifier in pool.eliminateReserveDeficit(), the external visibility modifier allows any contract or address to call this function. As a result, malicious entities could potentially trigger the logic for burning claims and reducing the reserves' deficits without being the approved Umbrella entity.

To eliminate deficit, pool.eliminateReserveDeficit() is first triggered as shown below:
```solidity
function eliminateReserveDeficit(address asset, uint256 amount) external override onlyUmbrella {
    LiquidationLogic.executeEliminateDeficit(
      _reserves,
      _usersConfig[msg.sender],
      DataTypes.ExecuteEliminateDeficitParams({asset: asset, amount: amount})
    );
  }
```
onlyUmbrella modifier is used to ensure that burning of claims can only be performed by a permissioned UMBRELLA entity registered on the PoolAddressesProvider. However, the function [executeEliminateDeficit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L96) called within pool.eliminateReserveDeficit() which contains the logic for burning of claims is marked external. This means unauthorized entities can easily bypass the check in pool.eliminateReserveDeficit() by calling [executeEliminateDeficit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L96) directly.

As seen here, there is no access control to restrict this function from being called by unauthorized users:

```solidity
function executeEliminateDeficit(
    mapping(address => DataTypes.ReserveData) storage reservesData,
    DataTypes.UserConfigurationMap storage userConfig,
    DataTypes.ExecuteEliminateDeficitParams memory params
  ) external {
    require(params.amount != 0, Errors.INVALID_AMOUNT);

    DataTypes.ReserveData storage reserve = reservesData[params.asset];
    uint256 currentDeficit = reserve.deficit;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

The executeEliminateDeficit function called through pool.eliminateReserveDeficit() is externally callable.

### External Pre-conditions

An unauthorized user directly calls [executeEliminateDeficit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L96)

### Attack Path

1. A malicious user calls executeEliminateDeficit directly because it is marked external.
2. The attacker bypasses the access control provided by onlyUmbrella.
3. The attacker executes the deficit elimination process, successfully burning claims and modifying the reserve's deficit balance, which should be controlled by the permissioned Umbrella entity.
4. If this logic is abused, it could lead to incorrect adjustments to the reserve balances and the improper management of the deficit, resulting in potential financial loss and protocol instability.

### Impact

1. Unauthorized access to burning claim leading to financial loss.
2. Breaking of invariant.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

The function executeEliminateDeficit should be marked as internal or private to restrict access to only the contract and entities explicitly allowed

```solidity
       function executeEliminateDeficit(
           mapping(address => DataTypes.ReserveData) storage reservesData,
           DataTypes.UserConfigurationMap storage userConfig,
           DataTypes.ExecuteEliminateDeficitParams memory params
       ) internal {  // Change to internal instead of external
           // Function logic here
       }
```
