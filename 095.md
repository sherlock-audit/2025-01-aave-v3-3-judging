# makeWeb3safe - Insufficicient integer type precision in `unbacked` token minting

### Summary

Forced uint256 to uint128 casting will cause an artificial supply cap and potential transaction failure for user and integrators as users attempting large mints will encounter reverts on legitimate minting operations above uint128max

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BridgeLogic.sol#L76
The root cause lies in the forced downcasting of the unbacked amount.
this create two issues:
1. The storage variable `reserve.unbacked` is defined as uint128 instead uint256
2. The `amount` parameters is forcefully downcast without proper validation or handling.

The limitation means that:

1. Maximum single mint amount = 340,282,366,920,938,463,463,374,607,431,768,211,455 (uint128.max)
2. For a token with 18 decimals, this equals approximately 340.28 tokens
3 Total unbacked supply cannot exceed uint128.max

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. First `amount` starts as a uint256, which holdd value up to 2^256-1
```javascript
// uint256 range: 0 to 115792089237316195423570985008687907853269984665640564039457584007913129639935
// uint128 range: 0 to 340282366920938463463374607431768211455
```
2 Then it forcefully cast to uint128 with `.toUint128()`
- If amount > type(uint128).max (340282366920938463463374607431768211455), the transaction will revert
- This means you can never mint more than 340,282,366,920 tokens even if you have 18 decimals
- For a token with 18 decimals, this limits the actual token amount to approximately 340.28 tokens
3. The risk amnifest in two ways
```javascript
// Scenario 1: Direct Precision Loss
uint256 largeAmount = 340282366920938463463374607431768211456; // Just over uint128.max
uint128 converted = uint128(largeAmount); // This will revert

// Scenario 2: Accumulated Precision Loss
uint256 amount1 = 340282366920938463463374607431768211455; // uint128.max
uint256 amount2 = 1; 
uint128 result = uint128(amount1) + uint128(amount2); // This will overflow
```


### Impact

Transaction failures for legitimate minting operations

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

```diff
// Update storage variable to uint256
struct ReserveData {
+ uint256 unbacked;  // Changed from uint128
   
}

// Remove downcasting
+ uint256 unbacked = reserve.unbacked += amount;
```
