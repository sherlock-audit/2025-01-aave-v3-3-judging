# Reentrancy Vulnerability in repayETH Function Allows Repeated Repayments

### Summary

A reentrancy vulnerability in the repayETH function will lead to the protocol contract losing funds, as a malicious contract can repeatedly repay debt, due to the lack of reentrancy protection and state updates before external calls.

### Root Cause

In repayETH function within the contract, the lack of a reentrancy lock combined with the external call to POOL.repay() before updating internal state allows for recursive calls and therefore multiple repayments to be triggered during the same transaction.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1.A malicious contract needs to be deployed with the capability to call repayETH.
2.The attacker needs to borrow some WETH from the pool
3.The repayETH function has to receive a msg.value sufficient to cover the repayment amount.

### External Pre-conditions

There are no specific external protocol changes needed to exploit this vulnerability, it is internal to the contracts code itself.

### Attack Path

1.A malicious contract borrows WETH from the pool
2.The malicious contract calls repayETH, setting its own address as onBehalfOf and sending an appropriate msg.value.
3.The WETH.deposit call converts the sent ETH into WETH.
4.The POOL.repay() call triggers a callback to the malicious contract as its the address of onBehalfOf.
5.The malicious contract's callback re-enters repayETH, causing the repayment process to repeat before the initial call is complete.

### Impact

The protocol will suffer a loss of funds as the attacker repeatedly repays the debt and drains the funds within the pool.
