# Division by zero in `cumulateToLiquidityIndex` function can halt reserve functionality.

### Summary:
A lack of a zero-check for `totalLiquidity` in `cumulateToLiquidityIndex` will cause a **transaction revert** for **protocol users**, as the function will attempt to divide by zero during liquidity index updates.

---

### Root Cause:
In [ReserveLogic.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ReserveLogic.sol#L125), the `amount.wadToRay().rayDiv(totalLiquidity.wadToRay())` computation does not check if `totalLiquidity` is zero, resulting in a revert.

---

### Internal Pre-conditions:
1. The reserve must have `totalLiquidity` set to exactly `0` (e.g., during initialization or if fully drained).
2. A function invoking `cumulateToLiquidityIndex` (e.g., fee accumulation) must be called.

---

### External Pre-conditions:
1. No liquidity providers have deposited into the reserve, or all liquidity has been withdrawn.

---

### Attack Path:
1. **Any user or external contract** calls a function that attempts to accumulate income to the liquidity index.
2. The call triggers `cumulateToLiquidityIndex`, which attempts to divide `amount` by `totalLiquidity`.
3. As `totalLiquidity` is zero, the transaction reverts, halting the operation.

---

### Impact:
The **protocol functionality halts**, preventing fees (e.g., flash loan fees) from being distributed and disrupting reserve operations. No direct loss occurs, but user actions dependent on this functionality (e.g., supply or withdrawal) are blocked.

---

### Mitigation:
Add a guard condition to ensure `totalLiquidity` is non-zero before performing the division.
