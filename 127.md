# Malicious users can exploit interest rate inconsistency affecting protocol solvency

### Summary

Ignoring `stableBorrowRateEnabled` flag can cause significant economic damage to the protocol as malicious users exploit interest rate arbitrage when stable and variable rates become misaligned


### Root Cause

In src/contracts/helpers/AaveProtocolDataProvider.sol#101 (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/helpers/AaveProtocolDataProvider.sol#L101) the `stableBorrowRateEnabled` flag from `configuration.getFlags()` is ignored, which can lead to incorrect interest rate mode decisions




### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `AaveProtocolDataProvider` needs to have `stableBorrowRateEnabled` flag ignored in `getFlags()` return values
2. The market conditions need to create a significant spread between stable and variable rates
3. Users need to have sufficient collateral to borrow large amounts


### External Pre-conditions

Market volatility causes variable rates to move significantly

### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors the actual `stableBorrowRateEnabled` status through direct contract calls
2. When stable rates are significantly lower than variable rates but should be disabled:
   a. Attacker borrows large amounts using stable rate when UI/integration shows it should be impossible
   b. Interest rates continue to diverge due to market conditions
3. Attacker later refinances to variable rate when profitable
4. Repeats the process across multiple assets

### Impact

1.  The protocol suffers significant losses due to interest rate arbitrage, estimated around 2-5% APY loss on affected assets
2. Users face increased borrowing costs as the protocol tries to rebalance rates
3. The protocol's economic model becomes unstable

            1, // Stable rate mode
            0, // referralCode
            msg.sender
        );

        // Step 2: Wait for rates to diverge further
        // This would happen over time in real scenario
        
        // Step 3: Switch to variable rate when profitable

            USDC,
            1 // from stable to variable
        );
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

1. Properly handle all return values from `configuration.getFlags()` including `stableBorrowRateEnabled`
2. Add explicit checks for `stableBorrowRateEnabled` before allowing stable rate borrows
3. Implement rate switching cooldown periods
4. Add circuit breakers for significant rate divergence
