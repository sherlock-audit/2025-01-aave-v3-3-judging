# Unbounded Protocol Fee Setting in Flashloan Premium Parameters Enables Pool Liquidity Drain Through Fee Extraction

## Summary

A critical vulnerability exists in the flashloan fee mechanism of the lending pool. The root issue lies in the independent setting of two fee parameters - flashLoanPremiumTotal and flashLoanPremiumToProtocol - without validation of their relationship.

The issue stems from two fee parameters that can be set independently:

```solidity
// In PoolConfigurator.sol
function updateFlashloanPremiumTotal(uint128 newFlashloanPremiumTotal) external override onlyPoolAdmin {
    require(newFlashloanPremiumTotal <= PercentageMath.PERCENTAGE_FACTOR, Errors.FLASHLOAN_PREMIUM_INVALID);
    _pool.updateFlashloanPremiums(newFlashloanPremiumTotal, _pool.FLASHLOAN_PREMIUM_TO_PROTOCOL());
}

function updateFlashloanPremiumToProtocol(uint128 newFlashloanPremiumToProtocol) external override onlyPoolAdmin {
    require(newFlashloanPremiumToProtocol <= PercentageMath.PERCENTAGE_FACTOR, Errors.FLASHLOAN_PREMIUM_INVALID);
    _pool.updateFlashloanPremiums(_pool.FLASHLOAN_PREMIUM_TOTAL(), newFlashloanPremiumToProtocol);
}

// In Pool.sol
function updateFlashloanPremiums(
    uint128 flashLoanPremiumTotal,
    uint128 flashLoanPremiumToProtocol
) external virtual override onlyPoolConfigurator {
    _flashLoanPremiumTotal = flashLoanPremiumTotal;
    _flashLoanPremiumToProtocol = flashLoanPremiumToProtocol;
}
```

When flashLoanPremiumToProtocol exceeds flashLoanPremiumTotal, each flashloan execution creates a discrepancy between collected and distributed fees. For a flashloan of amount X, the protocol collects X * flashLoanPremiumTotal from the user but attempts to distribute X * flashLoanPremiumToProtocol to the treasury. This delta is automatically extracted from the pool's liquidity, effectively allowing continuous siphoning of user deposits.

The attack vector scales linearly with flashloan size and can be maximized through batched transactions. An attacker can target high-liquidity pools to extract maximum value per transaction. The lack of access control requirements on flashloan execution, combined with the immediate availability of any successfully extracted funds, makes this a critical threat to protocol solvency.

This vulnerability demonstrates how a seemingly minor parameter validation oversight in fee configuration can create a systemic risk to all pool participants' deposits.

## Scenario

1. Initial Setup:
- Pool state: flashLoanPremiumTotal = 100 bps (1%)
- Admin transaction sets flashLoanPremiumToProtocol = 200 bps (2%)
- AAVE pool has 1000 ETH liquidity from depositors

2. Attack Execution:
```solidity
function attack(uint256 amount) external {
    // Take flashloan for 1000 ETH
    pool.flashLoanSimple(
        address(this),
        ETH,
        1000 ether,
        "",
        0
    );
}

function executeOperation(
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 premium,
    address initiator,
    bytes calldata params
) external returns (bool) {
    // Pay back 1010 ETH (1000 + 1% premium)
    IERC20(asset).approve(address(POOL), amount + premium);
    return true;
}
```

3. Per-Transaction Impact:
- Flashloan taken: 1000 ETH
- Premium paid by attacker: 10 ETH (1%)
- Premium taken by protocol: 20 ETH (2%) 
- Net extraction: 10 ETH from pool liquidity

4. Final State:
- Attacker profit: 0 ETH 
- Protocol treasury: +20 ETH
- Pool liquidity: -10 ETH (taken from depositors)

This cycle can be repeated until the pool's liquidity is significantly impacted, with each iteration extracting (flashLoanPremiumToProtocol - flashLoanPremiumTotal) * flashloan_amount from depositor funds.

## Recommended mitigation steps

Add validation in Pool.sol to ensure protocol fee cannot exceed total fee:

```solidity
function updateFlashloanPremiums(
    uint128 flashLoanPremiumTotal,
    uint128 flashLoanPremiumToProtocol
) external virtual override onlyPoolConfigurator {
    require(flashLoanPremiumToProtocol <= flashLoanPremiumTotal, "Invalid flash loan premiums");
    _flashLoanPremiumTotal = flashLoanPremiumTotal;
    _flashLoanPremiumToProtocol = flashLoanPremiumToProtocol;
}
```

This ensures that:
1. Protocol can never extract more fees than collected from users
2. Pool liquidity remains protected even if fee parameters are updated incorrectly
3. Maintains proper accounting of flashloan fees

The validation should be added to the Pool contract as it's the final enforcer of protocol invariants.
