# Rounding Error Can Incorrectly Classify a User as Having “No Collateral Left,” Forcing Protocol to Absorb Unnecessary Bad Debt

### Summary

In `executeLiquidationCall()`, the variable` hasNoCollateralLeft` is computed via an equality check:

`bool hasNoCollateralLeft = vars.totalCollateralInBaseCurrency == vars.collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency;`

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L357-L358

Because both `totalCollateralInBaseCurrency` and `collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency` rely on integer division in their respective calculations, the equality can be incorrectly satisfied when there is still a small fraction of collateral remaining. As a result, the code proceeds to call `_burnBadDebt(),` treating the user’s leftover debt as “unrecoverable” and adding it to the reserve’s deficit. In effect, the protocol writes off a portion of the user’s debt and the user walks away with leftover collateral that was never seized.



### Root Cause

1-Integer Division in Price Conversions

- vars.totalCollateralInBaseCurrency comes from GenericLogic.calculateUserAccountData, which converts each collateral amount into base currency by integer division.
- vars.collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency is similarly computed with integer division in _calculateAvailableCollateralToLiquidate.

2-Exact Equality Check
The logic vars.totalCollateralInBaseCurrency == vars.collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency is too strict in an environment where integer division often floors small fractional amounts. A leftover fraction of collateral might not appear in `collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency`, tricking the code into thinking all collateral was seized.

3-Premature Activation of _`burnBadDebt()`
Once `hasNoCollateralLeft` is **true**, `_burnBadDebt() `is **invoked,** **zeroing** out all remaining user debt across reserves and incrementing` reserve.deficit`. This results in a net loss to the protocol if the user truly still has some residual collateral.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Assume the following:

-A borrower deposits collateral worth 100.9999999 (in base currency terms) but due to integer truncation, GenericLogic.calculateUserAccountData sees 100 as total collateral.
-The user borrows an amount that puts their Health Factor slightly below 1.

Liquidation

-A liquidator calls executeLiquidationCall() and finds vars.collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency = 100 (rounded down).
-Because both values match at 100 in integer form, hasNoCollateralLeft becomes true.

Bad Debt Forgiveness

-The code calls _burnBadDebt(), treating the unliquidated fraction of collateral as if it does not exist.
-All remaining user debt is added to the reserve’s deficit and effectively “forgiven.”

User Retains Hidden Collateral

-The user (borrower) can later withdraw or re-supply the leftover fraction (0.9999999), effectively escaping part of their original debt.

### Impact

Monetary Loss for the Protocol: The leftover fraction of collateral remains with the user, yet the protocol absorbs the full shortfall in deficit.

Potential Sybil or Bot Exploits: An attacker can automate small fractional leftover strategies to scale up repeated bad-debt write-offs.

Destabilization of Reserve Health: Excessive, unaccounted deficits reduce overall pool solvency and can compromise the protocol’s standing liquidity.

### PoC

```solidity
// Suppose user has 100.9999 "units" of collateral.
// For integer math in Aave (e.g. GenericLogic), it shows as 100.

// Liquidation tries to seize 100 units (collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency = 100).
bool hasNoCollateralLeft = 100 == 100; // true, though 0.9999 remains unaccounted

// Protocol logic treats the user as fully out of collateral, calls _burnBadDebt().
// userReserveDebt gets added to 'deficit', even though user still effectively has ~0.9999 of collateral.
```


### Mitigation

**Use Greater-Than-or-Equal Check with a Small Buffer**
Instead of strict equality, compare the total collateral seized with a small tolerance margin or check if the difference is “negligible.”

```solidity

if (
  vars.totalCollateralInBaseCurrency <= vars.collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency + TOLERANCE
) {
    hasNoCollateralLeft = true;
}
```
This will prevent an exact equality from firing if there is still a fractional leftover.

**Store Collateral & Debt in Higher Precision:**
Move to a ray or wad representation for base currency conversions to reduce rounding errors. Then only floor once final amounts are computed.

**Post-Liquidation Check on Actual Collateral Balance:**
After liquidation, re-check the user’s real on-chain `balanceOf()` or scaled balance in `aToken` to confirm the user truly has zero collateral. If a minimal leftover remains, skip` _burnBadDebt().`
