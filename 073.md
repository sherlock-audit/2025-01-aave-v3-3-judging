# Unchecked Arithmetic in Borrow Cap Validation

### Summary  
The `ValidationLogic:validateBorrow` function contains an unchecked arithmetic operation when calculating `vars.totalDebt`. This can lead to potential overflows, allowing malicious actors to bypass borrow cap validations. Utilizing unchecked arithmetic without proper safeguards introduces risks of unexpected behavior in the smart contract.

---

### Description  
In the `ValidationLogic:validateBorrow` function, the following operation is performed:  
```solidity
vars.totalDebt = vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt + params.amount;
unchecked {
    require(vars.totalDebt <= vars.borrowCap * vars.assetUnit, Errors.BORROW_CAP_EXCEEDED);
}
```
The addition of `vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt` and `params.amount` is done outside of a checked arithmetic block, meaning it is susceptible to overflow. If `vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt` or `params.amount` is maliciously manipulated to near-maximum values, an overflow could occur, resulting in a calculated `vars.totalDebt` that is much smaller than the actual value. This would allow malicious borrowers to bypass the borrow cap check (`vars.totalDebt <= vars.borrowCap * vars.assetUnit`).

---

### Root Cause  
The unchecked arithmetic operation occurs at this line:
```solidity
vars.totalDebt = vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt + params.amount;
```

### Impact  
- **Severity**: High  
- **Risk**: Exploitable overflow in the calculation of `vars.totalDebt` could lead to a failure in enforcing the borrow cap, compromising the protocol’s risk management mechanisms.  
- **Consequences**: An attacker can borrow beyond the set borrow cap, which can destabilize the protocol, drain liquidity pools, and harm users’ funds.

---

### Proof of Concept (PoC)  
Assume:
- `vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt = 2^256 - 1` (maximum `uint256` value)
- `params.amount = 1`

**Calculation without overflow check:**  
```solidity
vars.totalDebt = vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt + params.amount;
// vars.totalDebt overflows to 0
```
The borrow cap validation:  
```solidity
require(vars.totalDebt <= vars.borrowCap * vars.assetUnit, Errors.BORROW_CAP_EXCEEDED);
// This validation passes since vars.totalDebt is now 0 due to overflow
```

This enables an attacker to bypass the borrow cap and borrow unrestricted amounts.

### Foundry Test Code

```solidity
// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.18;

import "forge-std/Test.sol";

contract ValidateBorrowTest is Test {
    // Mock of Errors used in the contract
    string constant BORROW_CAP_EXCEEDED = "BORROW_CAP_EXCEEDED";

    // Struct to simulate the function's variables
    struct Vars {
        uint256 totalSupplyVariableDebt;
        uint256 totalDebt;
        uint256 borrowCap;
        uint256 assetUnit;
    }

    // Function simulating validateBorrow
    function validateBorrow(Vars memory vars, uint256 amount) public pure {
        vars.totalDebt = vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt + amount;
        unchecked {
            require(
                vars.totalDebt <= vars.borrowCap * vars.assetUnit,
                BORROW_CAP_EXCEEDED
            );
        }
    }

    function testUncheckedArithmeticOverflow() public {
        // Arrange
        Vars memory vars;
        vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt = type(uint256).max; // Max uint256 value
        vars.borrowCap = 10; // Example borrow cap
        vars.assetUnit = 1 ether; // Example asset unit

        uint256 paramsAmount = 1; // Value to cause overflow

        // Act & Assert
        vm.expectRevert(bytes(BORROW_CAP_EXCEEDED)); // Expect the borrow cap to be bypassed
        validateBorrow(vars, paramsAmount); // Trigger the vulnerability
    }
}
```

### Explanation of the Code

1. **Setup the Variables:**
   - `vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt` is set to `type(uint256).max`, which is the maximum value a `uint256` can hold (`2^256 - 1`).
   - `params.amount` is set to `1`, which will cause an overflow when added to `vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt`.

2. **Simulate the Vulnerability:**
   - The function `validateBorrow` performs unchecked arithmetic using `unchecked` block, causing the overflow.
   - When the overflow occurs, `vars.totalDebt` wraps around to `0`.

3. **Check the Behavior:**
   - The test expects a revert with the error `BORROW_CAP_EXCEEDED`. However, due to the overflow, the `require` condition incorrectly evaluates as `true`, and no revert occurs.
   - This demonstrates how the overflow bypasses the borrow cap validation.

4. **Use `vm.expectRevert`:**
   - This ensures that the test verifies if the borrow cap validation is bypassed.

---

### Run the Test
   ```bash
   forge test --match-path test/ValidateBorrowTest.sol
   ```
 Observe the results. If the vulnerability exists, the test will fail to revert, proving the exploit.

---

### Fix Verification
After applying the recommended mitigation (using checked arithmetic), rerun the test. The test should pass, as the borrow cap validation will no longer be bypassed due to overflow.


---

### Recommended Mitigation  
To prevent overflow, the arithmetic operation should use checked arithmetic provided by libraries such as OpenZeppelin’s `SafeMath` or the built-in overflow checks introduced in Solidity 0.8. Specifically:

1. **Use Checked Arithmetic:**
   Replace the arithmetic operation with checked arithmetic:
   ```solidity
   vars.totalDebt = vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt + params.amount;
   require(vars.totalDebt <= vars.borrowCap * vars.assetUnit, Errors.BORROW_CAP_EXCEEDED);
   ```

2. **Explicit Safeguards:**
   Alternatively, if unchecked arithmetic is required for gas optimization, ensure that inputs (`vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt` and `params.amount`) are validated beforehand to ensure they cannot approach values that would cause an overflow:
   ```solidity
   require(vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt + params.amount >= vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt, "Arithmetic overflow detected");
   vars.totalDebt = vars.totalSupplyVariableDebt + params.amount;
   ```

By incorporating these measures, the borrow cap validation will reliably enforce the intended constraints and prevent overflow vulnerabilities.
