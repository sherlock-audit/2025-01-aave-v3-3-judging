# Rounding Exploit in Isolation Mode Lets User Exceed the Debt Ceiling

# Micro-Borrow Rounding Exploit in Isolation Mode

### Summary

A user can exceed the isolation mode debt ceiling by repeatedly borrowing amounts too small to increment `isolationModeTotalDebt` due to integer division flooring. Although the exploit may seem minor on Ethereum mainnet (where gas fees are high), it becomes *far more feasible on low-gas networks* (Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base) or if the attacker batches many micro-borrows in a **single** transaction/rollup. This undermines the debt ceiling’s purpose and can expose the protocol to undercollateralized risk.

---

## Root Cause

When a user borrows in isolation mode, the code updates `isolationModeTotalDebt` as follows:
```solidity
isolationModeTotalDebt += (
    params.amount / 10^(reserveDecimals - DEBT_CEILING_DECIMALS)
).toUint128();
```
If `params.amount` is smaller than `10^(reserveDecimals - DEBT_CEILING_DECIMALS)`, integer division produces `0`, *failing* to increase the total debt count. An attacker can exploit this by performing multiple tiny borrows, each individually floored to `0` increment.

---

## Attack Scenario

1. **Isolation Collateral**  
   - The user provides collateral in isolation mode, which has a set `debtCeiling`.

2. **Repeated Micro-Borrows**  
   - They call `executeBorrow(...)` multiple times with an amount `x` such that `(x / scale) == 0` after integer division. For instance, if `scale = 100`, they can repeatedly borrow 99 units.

3. **No Increase in `isolationModeTotalDebt`**  
   - Since `(99 / 100) = 0`, the debt ceiling value never increments. The protocol “thinks” the user’s total borrowed amount in isolation mode remains 0 (or near zero).

4. **High Aggregate Debt**  
   - With enough micro-borrows (especially cheap on L2 or batched in a single transaction), the user accumulates a large total borrowed balance.  
   - Meanwhile, `isolationModeTotalDebt` is not updated accordingly, so the user remains under the official isolation debt ceiling threshold.

5. **Potential Under-Collateralization**  
   - If the user accumulates far more debt than the protocol’s intended limit, the risk model for that isolated collateral breaks. In worst-case scenarios, it could lead to a deficit if liquidation is insufficient.

---

## Why It would be a Concern

1. **L2 / Sidechain Feasibility**  
   - On networks like Polygon, Arbitrum, Optimism, Base, or any low-gas environment, repeatedly calling small borrows can be **cheap** enough to outweigh interest. Even on mainnet, a single batched transaction (via multicall) could bundle many small borrows.

2. **Defeats Debt Ceiling’s Core Purpose**  
   - The entire point of the ceiling is to cap total debt for certain high-risk collateral. If micro-borrows circumvent that cap, the protocol’s isolation mechanism is effectively undone.

3. **Single-Block or Single-Tx Accumulation**  
   - A specialized smart contract can chain hundreds of tiny borrows in one transaction. The user pays gas once, effectively making the cost *less* prohibitive.

4. **User Can Exit Quickly**  
   - If the user sees market conditions deteriorate, they can repay or vanish with the borrowed liquidity. The protocol sees no forced coverage because it never recognized the correct total isolation debt in time.

5. **Not Fully Mitigated by “Dust Minimum”**  
   - While certain front-ends impose minimum borrow sizes, a determined attacker or advanced user can call the pool contract directly with micro-borrows. This is a likely scenario for sophisticated MEV or arbing bots.

---

## Impact

- **Bypassing a Core Risk Control**: The user’s real borrowed amount can climb well above the debt ceiling.  
- **Exposure to Bad Debt**: If the user’s position becomes undercollateralized and the protocol believed the ceiling prevented it from happening, the protocol might be slow to respond or to trigger protective measures.  
- **Governance / Risk Team Surprise**: If the community relies on “X million” as the total maximum debt, but an attacker surpasses it, they could cause unexpected shortfalls in worst-case scenarios.

## Proof of Concept (Simplified)

```solidity
// Suppose the isolation asset has decimals=18, DEBT_CEILING_DECIMALS=16 => scale=10^(18-16)=100.
// Borrow 99 tokens repeatedly:
uint256 microBorrow = 99; 
// 99 / 100 = 0 => isolationModeTotalDebt += 0

// The user accumulates 9900 tokens after 100 calls in one transaction, 
// but isolationModeTotalDebt is still unchanged (0 or near 0).
```

---

## Mitigation Options

1. **Minimum Borrow Enforcement**  
   ```solidity
   require(
     (params.amount / 10**(reserveDecimals - DEBT_CEILING_DECIMALS)) > 0,
     "Cannot borrow below increment threshold"
   );
   ```
   Prevent any borrow that doesn’t at least increment the isolation total by 1.

2. **Accumulate Remainders**  
   - Track the “fractional leftover” from each division and add it to a stored “remainder.” Once it exceeds 1 in scaled terms, increment the `isolationModeTotalDebt`. This ensures 100 micro-borrows still add up to 1 or more eventually.

3. **Front-End / Contract Batching Limits**  
   - Official Aave front-ends (and widely used integrators) can disallow small borrows, but an on-chain solution would be safer, as advanced users can skip the UI.

## Addressing It Is Beneficial 

- **Enhances Risk Model Integrity**  
  The isolation mode’s debt ceiling becomes robust against corner-case gaming.  
- **Protects on L2**  
  As Aave expands to cheaper chains, this scenario grows more plausible.  
- **Keeps Aave’s Codebase Consistent**  
  The fix is straightforward and does not significantly add complexity.
