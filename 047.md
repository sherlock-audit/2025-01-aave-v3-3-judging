# Lack of Input Validation in executeRepay Function in BorrowLogic Contract

**## **Summary**

This report identifies a **lack of input validation** in the `executeRepay` function within the `BorrowLogic` library, which could potentially allow users to pass invalid parameters such as the `useATokens` value, causing unintended behaviors or errors in the contract. The lack of proper validation could have security implications in how the function operates, especially in the context of token repayments.

## **Description**

The `executeRepay` function is responsible for processing repayments of borrowed assets. It allows users to repay loans using either the underlying asset or aTokens. However, a critical input parameter, `params.useATokens`, is used without validating its value before it is processed.

### Issue:
- **Unvalidated input**: The `params.useATokens` value, which determines whether the user is repaying using aTokens, is used directly without validation. This may lead to incorrect behavior if an invalid or unexpected value is provided.

### Affected Function:
- `executeRepay` in the **BorrowLogic** library.

## **Root Cause**

The root cause of the issue is the absence of input validation for the `params.useATokens` parameter in the `executeRepay` function.

### Location:
- Line 179: `if (params.useATokens && params.amount == type(uint256).max) { ... }`
- Line 210: `if (params.useATokens) { ... }`

The `params.useATokens` parameter is used without ensuring that its value is within the expected range, i.e., a boolean value indicating whether the repayment should be done using aTokens or not.

## **Impact**

This issue could cause several potential impacts:
1. **Unexpected Behavior**: If an unexpected value (other than `true` or `false`) is passed for `params.useATokens`, the function may execute in an unintended way.
2. **Security Vulnerability**: While this issue may not be an immediate exploit, the lack of validation opens the contract up to potential issues or abuse in future interactions, especially with untrusted or malicious actors.
3. **Incorrect Debt Repayment**: The repayment process could malfunction if the value is improperly passed, causing incorrect repayment amounts or behavior with aTokens and underlying assets.
   
The severity of this issue can range from medium to high, depending on the context in which the contract is used and how inputs are handled.

## **Proof of Concept (PoC)**

Hereâ€™s a simple Proof of Concept (PoC) that demonstrates the issue:

- **Step 1**: Call the `executeRepay` function with an invalid value for `params.useATokens` (e.g., a value other than `true` or `false`).
  
```solidity
// Example of invalid input (invalid value for useATokens)
params.useATokens = 2;  // Invalid value
params.amount = 1000; // Some valid amount
```

- **Step 2**: Observe that the contract does not validate the value of `params.useATokens`, and proceeds with the repayment logic, possibly causing errors or unwanted behavior.

## **Mitigation**

To mitigate this issue, it is necessary to validate the `params.useATokens` parameter before using it in any conditional logic.

### Suggested Fix:
Add input validation for the `params.useATokens` value to ensure it is a boolean value, as it is expected to be used for a logical comparison:

```solidity
require(params.useATokens == true || params.useATokens == false, "Invalid value for useATokens");
```

This simple validation step ensures that the value is either `true` or `false`, thus avoiding any unexpected behavior.
