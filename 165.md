# getNormalizedIncome() Uses Linear Instead of Compound Interest Causing Systematic Protocol Deficits

## Summary

The protocol's interest rate mechanism contains a critical economic design flaw in its asymmetric interest calculation approach. The `getNormalizedIncome` function uses `calculateLinearInterest` for lending while borrowing operations use `calculateCompoundedInterest`, creating a mathematical mismatch in interest accrual.

The linear interest calculation in `getNormalizedIncome` grows arithmetically:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ReserveLogic.sol#L46

```solidity
return MathUtils.calculateLinearInterest(reserve.currentLiquidityRate, timestamp).rayMul(
    reserve.liquidityIndex
);
```

While the compound interest calculation grows exponentially, causing systematic deficits. This divergence is demonstrated through the interest formulas:

Linear (Lending): Principal × Rate × Time
Compound (Borrowing): Principal × (1 + Rate)^Time

For a 1000 token position at 10% APR over 2 years:
Lending return: 1000 + (1000 × 0.10 × 2) = 1200 tokens
Borrowing debt: 1000 × (1.10)² = 1210 tokens
Deficit: 10 tokens

This deficit compounds with higher rates, longer durations, and larger positions, leading to protocol insolvency risk that cannot be mitigated through parameter adjustments or normal operations.

## Recommended mitigation steps

The `getNormalizedIncome` function should be modified to use compound interest, aligning with borrowing-side calculations:

```solidity
function getNormalizedIncome(
    DataTypes.ReserveData storage reserve
) internal view returns (uint256) {
    uint40 timestamp = reserve.lastUpdateTimestamp;
    return (timestamp == block.timestamp) 
        ? reserve.liquidityIndex 
        : MathUtils.calculateCompoundedInterest(reserve.currentLiquidityRate, timestamp)
            .rayMul(reserve.liquidityIndex);
}
```

This requires a protocol migration to compound interest with comprehensive testing of interest accrual symmetry between lending and borrowing operations. Implementation should include automated balance verification mechanisms to ensure ongoing asset-liability alignment.
