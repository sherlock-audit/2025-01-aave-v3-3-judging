# DoS in Liquidation Workflow

### Summary



The `_burnBadDebt` function in the liquidation logic iterates through all active reserves to clean up bad debt. This design introduces a linear gas cost increase proportional to the number of reserves (`reservesCount`). On high-traffic chains like Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, and Polygon, which support numerous reserves, this function risks exceeding the block gas limit. The inefficiency is particularly critical during periods of network congestion, making the function prone to failure and introducing operational risks to the protocol.

### Root Cause

The inefficiency stems from the iteration logic used in `_burnBadDebt`:

```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < reservesCount; i++) {
    if (!userConfig.isBorrowing(i)) {
        continue;
    }
    ...
    _burnDebtTokens(...);
}
```

1. **Iterative Overhead**: The loop evaluates all reserves, regardless of whether they contain bad debt.
2. **No Filtering Mechanism**: Reserves with no bad debt are still processed, incurring unnecessary gas costs.


### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

This issue arises in the following scenarios:

1. **High Reserve Count**:
   - The protocol is designed to handle a large number of reserves across chains like Ethereum, Arbitrum, and Polygon.
   - If `reservesCount` reaches 100+ and only a fraction (e.g., 20) of reserves have bad debt, the loop still iterates through all reserves, wasting gas.

2. **Complex User Configurations**:
   - Users with debt positions across multiple reserves further complicate the iteration, as each reserve must be checked for active debt.

3. **Gas Constraints on Congested Chains**:
   - Chains with high gas prices (e.g., Ethereum) exacerbate the inefficiency, as gas consumption per iteration can render the function unusable during network congestion.


### Impact

1. **Liquidation Failures**:
   - Liquidators face prohibitive gas costs when attempting to clear bad debt.
   - Positions with bad debt may fail to liquidate, potentially destabilizing the protocol.

2. **Denial of Service**:
   - The high gas cost disincentivizes liquidators, leading to unaddressed bad debt. Over time, this can result in cascading insolvency.

3. **Cross-Chain Vulnerability**:
   - Chains like Ethereum and Polygon, known for high gas costs and congestion, are especially vulnerable. Even moderate reserve counts on these chains could cause the function to fail.


### PoC

**Scenario**:
- **Reserve Count**: 100 reserves.
- **Bad Debt Distribution**: Only 20 reserves contain bad debt.
- **Gas Cost Analysis**: The loop processes all 100 reserves, even though only 20 need attention.

**Executing**:
1. Trigger `_burnBadDebt` under high gas conditions.
2. Observe the excessive gas consumption due to unnecessary iterations.

**Consequences:**
- The function fails as gas limits are exceeded.
- The liquidation backlog increases, leading to protocol inefficiencies.


### Mitigation

### **Mitigation**

1. **Priority Queue for Reserve Management**: Implement a priority queue to dynamically track and prioritize reserves with active bad debt. Reserves are processed based on urgency (e.g., debt severity or utilization rate), significantly reducing unnecessary iterations. This ensures efficient handling of reserves, particularly on high-traffic chains like Ethereum or Polygon.

2. **Event-Driven Reserve Tracking**: Utilize event-driven architecture to maintain a real-time mapping of reserves with active bad debt. Events like `DeficitCreated` and `DeficitCleared` update a registry, allowing `_burnBadDebt` to iterate only over reserves flagged as active. This eliminates redundant computation while ensuring scalability and responsiveness.
