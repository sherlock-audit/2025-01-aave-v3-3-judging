# Unmasked LTV Input in setLtv() Function Enables Cross-Parameter Bitmap Corruption

## Summary
In the ReserveConfiguration library's `setLtv` function, there's a critical vulnerability where input validation fails to prevent values with higher bits set from corrupting other configuration parameters in the bitmap. While the function checks if the value is below MAX_VALID_LTV, it doesn't properly mask the input to ensure only the intended 16 bits are modified.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/configuration/ReserveConfiguration.sol#L73

```solidity
function setLtv(DataTypes.ReserveConfigurationMap memory self, uint256 ltv) internal pure {
    require(ltv <= MAX_VALID_LTV, Errors.INVALID_LTV);
    self.data = (self.data & ~LTV_MASK) | ltv;  // Vulnerable code
}
```

The issue lies in the bitwise operation that directly uses the unmasked `ltv` value. A value like 0x10003 (decimal 65539) would pass the MAX_VALID_LTV check (since 3 < 65535) but would corrupt configuration data in higher bits during the bitwise OR operation.

For example:

The LTV field in the configuration is allocated 16 bits, as shown by the mask:
```solidity
LTV_MASK = 0x000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000FFFF
```

Let's look at some numbers:

1. A valid LTV value like 65000:
```solidity
Binary: 0000 0000 0000 0000 1111 1101 1110 1000
Hex:    0x0000FDE8
```
This is fine because it's under MAX_VALID_LTV (65535) and only uses the first 16 bits.

2. Now consider this problematic value:
```solidity
Binary: 0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 
Hex:    0x10000
Decimal: 65536
```
This would fail the MAX_VALID_LTV check.

3. But here's where it gets tricky. Consider this value:
```solidity
Binary: 0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0011
Hex:    0x10003
Decimal: 65539
```
If we take just the lowest 16 bits, it's just 3 (well under MAX_VALID_LTV), but it has a '1' bit set in position 17.

The current code:
```solidity
require(ltv <= MAX_VALID_LTV, Errors.INVALID_LTV);
self.data = (self.data & ~LTV_MASK) | ltv;
```

would allow this value because 3 is less than MAX_VALID_LTV, but when the bitwise OR operation happens, that '1' in position 17 would corrupt the next parameter in the configuration bitmap.

To visualize:
```solidity
Existing config:   1111 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000
Input ltv:        0001 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0000 0011
~LTV_MASK:        1111 1111 1111 1111 1111 0000 0000 0000
                  ----------------------------------------
Result:           1111 0000 0000 0001 0000 0000 0000 0011
                                  ^
                                  |
                        This bit shouldn't be set!
```

## Scenario

1. An admin account calls `configureReserveAsCollateral()` with seemingly valid parameters including an `ltv` value that appears safe:

```solidity
// Admin call 
configurator.configureReserveAsCollateral(
  asset,
  0x10003, // Appears valid since 3 < MAX_VALID_LTV
  liquidationThreshold,
  liquidationBonus
);
```

2. Inside `configureReserveAsCollateral()`, this value is passed to `setLtv()`:
```solidity
currentConfig.setLtv(ltv); // ltv = 0x10003
```

3. In `setLtv()`, the value passes validation:
```solidity 
require(ltv <= MAX_VALID_LTV, Errors.INVALID_LTV); // Passes since 3 < 65535
```

4. The unmasked value is then used in bitwise operations:
```solidity
self.data = (self.data & ~LTV_MASK) | ltv; 
// ltv = 0x10003 has bit 17 set, corrupting liquidation threshold
```

5. The result: bit 17 is set in the configuration word, corrupting the liquidation threshold parameter that starts at position 16, while still appearing to set a valid LTV of 3.

## Impact

The vulnerability has severe implications for the protocol due to bitmap corruption. When corrupted values are passed to `setLtv()`, bits beyond position 16 could be set unexpectedly, directly affecting adjacent configuration parameters stored in the same storage slot. This includes critical risk parameters like liquidation thresholds and borrowing flags.

The corruption of these parameters is particularly dangerous because they control core protocol functionality. For example, if the liquidation threshold bits are corrupted, it could trigger or prevent liquidations incorrectly. Similarly, corrupted borrowing flags could enable or disable borrowing functionality unexpectedly. This creates a systemic risk where the protocol's risk parameters become unreliable.

Since `setLtv()` is called by privileged functions like `configureReserveAsCollateral()`, even properly authorized parameter updates could lead to unintended state changes. The impact extends beyond AAVE itself - protocols integrating with AAVE that read these configuration parameters would also be affected, potentially causing cascading failures if they make decisions based on corrupted values.

The end result is potential direct financial losses through incorrect liquidations, blocked withdrawals, or unauthorized borrowing, undermining the protocol's risk management system.

## Fix
To fix this, the input should be explicitly masked:
```solidity
self.data = (self.data & ~LTV_MASK) | (ltv & LTV_MASK);
```

This ensures only the lowest 16 bits of the input value are used, preventing any potential corruption of other configuration parameters stored in the same word.
