# `withdrawETHWithPermit` bypasses user-specified approval limits, enabling unauthorized full withdrawals.

### Summary

The missing validation of `permit` for the actual `amountToWithdraw` in [withdrawETHWithPermit](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/helpers/WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol#L141) will cause unauthorized withdrawals for users as malicious actors will exploit mismatched approval limits to withdraw the user's full balance.



### Root Cause

In `WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol`, the `permit` function validates [approval](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/helpers/WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol#L136-L138) for `amount`, but `transferFrom` is called with `amountToWithdraw`, potentially exceeding the user's intent.

When `amount` is set to `type(uint256).max`, the `amountToWithdraw` value is overridden to the user's full balance, regardless of the initial `amount` specified in the `permit`. This creates a mismatch between the permit approval (which is for amount) and the actual `amountToWithdraw` being processed.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User signs a `permit` for `amount` (e.g., limited approval).
2. User's `aWETH` balance is greater than or equal to `amountToWithdraw`.
3. Function input sets `amount` to a lower value than `amountToWithdraw` or `type(uint256).max`.

### External Pre-conditions

No restrictions are placed on `amountToWithdraw` being higher than the approved `amount`.


### Attack Path

1. Attacker calls `withdrawETHWithPermit` with:
- `amount == permit-limited approval`.
- `amountToWithdraw == userâ€™s full aWETH balance`.
2. Contract calls `permit` for the lesser `amount`, successfully validating the signature.
3. Contract executes `transferFrom` with `amountToWithdraw`, bypassing the intent of the user.
4. Excessive `aWETH` is withdrawn and unwrapped into ETH for the attacker.

### Impact

The user suffers a loss of their entire `aWETH` balance if `amountToWithdraw` exceeds their intended withdrawal limit. The attacker gains control of the withdrawn ETH.



### PoC

Validate the permit approval for amountToWithdraw instead of amount by modifying permit parameters in WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol`

### Mitigation

Validate the permit approval for `amountToWithdraw` instead of `amount` by modifying `permit` parameters in `WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol`
