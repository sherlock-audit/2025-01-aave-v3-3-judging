# A Paused reserve can still be used as collateral and can be supplied to

### Summary

`BridgeLogic.executeMintUnbacked()` fails to check if the reserve to be minted is paused.

### Root Cause

```solidity

 function executeMintUnbacked(//@audit-issue A frozen, A paused reserve can still be supplied to and used as collateral.
    mapping(address => DataTypes.ReserveData) storage reservesData,
    mapping(uint256 => address) storage reservesList,
    DataTypes.UserConfigurationMap storage userConfig,
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    address onBehalfOf,
    uint16 referralCode
  ) external {
    DataTypes.ReserveData storage reserve = reservesData[asset];
    DataTypes.ReserveCache memory reserveCache = reserve.cache();

    reserve.updateState(reserveCache);

    ValidationLogic.validateSupply(reserveCache, reserve, amount, onBehalfOf);

    uint256 unbackedMintCap = reserveCache.reserveConfiguration.getUnbackedMintCap();
    uint256 reserveDecimals = reserveCache.reserveConfiguration.getDecimals();

    uint256 unbacked = reserve.unbacked += amount.toUint128();

    require(
      unbacked <= unbackedMintCap * (10 ** reserveDecimals),
      Errors.UNBACKED_MINT_CAP_EXCEEDED
    );

    reserve.updateInterestRatesAndVirtualBalance(reserveCache, asset, 0, 0);

    bool isFirstSupply = IAToken(reserveCache.aTokenAddress).mint(//@audit-ok `executeMintUnbacked()` can fail to `setUsingAsCollateral()` for first-time supply user. (A malicious user can prevent this by transferring a very minuscule amount to `onBehalfOf`)
      msg.sender,
      onBehalfOf,
      amount,
      reserveCache.nextLiquidityIndex
    );

    if (isFirstSupply) {
      if (
        ValidationLogic.validateAutomaticUseAsCollateral(
          reservesData,
          reservesList,
          userConfig,
          reserveCache.reserveConfiguration,
          reserveCache.aTokenAddress
        )
      ) {
        userConfig.setUsingAsCollateral(reserve.id, true);
        emit ReserveUsedAsCollateralEnabled(asset, onBehalfOf);
      }
    }

    emit MintUnbacked(asset, msg.sender, onBehalfOf, amount, referralCode);
  }

```

There's no check whatsoever in the logic of `BridgeLogic.executeMintUnbacked()` to ascertain if the reserve to be minted is paused by admins.

So users can still mint unbacked for paused reserves and supply to them later via `BridgeLogic.executeBackUnbacked()`

This breaks the invariant where paused reserves shouldn't allow new supplies
```solidity
 /**
   * @notice Pauses a reserve. A paused reserve does not allow any interaction (supply, borrow, repay,
   * swap interest rate, liquidate, atoken transfers).
   * @param asset The address of the underlying asset of the reserve
   * @param paused True if pausing the reserve, false if unpausing
   * @param gracePeriod Count of seconds after unpause during which liquidations will not be available
   *   - Only applicable whenever unpausing (`paused` as false)
   *   - Passing 0 means no grace period
   *   - Capped to maximum MAX_GRACE_PERIOD
   */
  function setReservePause(address asset, bool paused, uint40 gracePeriod) external;

```

### Internal Pre-conditions

The logic of `BridgeLogic.executeMintUnbacked()` fails to check if the asset  reserve to be minted is paused. 

### External Pre-conditions

Can happen anytime, all the time

### Attack Path

1. Admins pause an asset reserve via `Poolconfigurator.setReserveFreeze()`
2. User doesn't know, he uses `BridgeLogic.executeMintUnbacked()` for that asset reserve and if all conditions are met it even sets the asset reserve as collateral for him
3. User later supplies to the reserve later via `BridgeLogic.executeBackUnbacked()`



### Impact

A asset reserve paused by admins can still be used as collateral and supplied to by users.

This breaks the invariant where paused reserves shouldn't allow new supplies

```solidity
 /**
   * @notice Pauses a reserve. A paused reserve does not allow any interaction (supply, borrow, repay,
   * swap interest rate, liquidate, atoken transfers).
   * @param asset The address of the underlying asset of the reserve
   * @param paused True if pausing the reserve, false if unpausing
   * @param gracePeriod Count of seconds after unpause during which liquidations will not be available
   *   - Only applicable whenever unpausing (`paused` as false)
   *   - Passing 0 means no grace period
   *   - Capped to maximum MAX_GRACE_PERIOD
   */
  function setReservePause(address asset, bool paused, uint40 gracePeriod) external;

```

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

check the flag of the asset reserve that `BridgeLogic.executeMintUnbacked()` is to be used for and revert if it is paused
