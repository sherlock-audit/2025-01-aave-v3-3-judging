# Deficit in Liquidation Due to Edge Case in Health Factor Calculation

### Summary

An edge case in the protocol's liquidation logic leads to incomplete debt recovery when a borrower’s healthFactor equals 1. This scenario occurs due to specific configurations of liquidationThreshold and liquidationBonus. Since liquidation only triggers when healthFactor < 1, borrowers in this state avoid liquidation, resulting in a deficit when collateral eventually becomes insufficient to fully cover the debt.

### Root Cause

The protocol uses the following formula to calculate the `healthFactor`:

healthFactor =

Liquidation only occurs if healthFactor < 1

However, if the healthFactor is exactly 1, liquidation does not trigger, even though the borrower is at the threshold of insolvency. This is exacerbated by the relationship between liquidationThreshold and liquidationBonus. When:
`liquidationThreshold.percentMul(liquidationBonus) == PercentageMath.PERCENTAGE_FACTOR`

The above relationship is possible because of the check while setting liquidationThreshold and `liquidationBonus`

Hene, the liquidation process can only recover the exact value of the collateral divided by the liquidationBonus, leaving an unliquidated debt.

### Attack Path

- **Scenario 1: Collateral and Debt Values Stabilizing Health Factor at 1**
- **Inputs:**
  - totalCollateralInBaseCurrency = 100
  - totalDebtInBaseCurrency = 80
  - liquidationThreshold = 80%
  - liquidationBonus = 125%

- **This will give a helth factor of 1**
- **Expected Behavior**: Liquidation should occur because the borrower is insolvent.
- **Actual Behavior**: Liquidation does not occur as the condition requires healthFactor < 1.

- **Scenario 2: Insufficient Collateral Leading to Deficit**
- **Initial State:**
  - totalCollateralInBaseCurrency = 100
  - totalDebtInBaseCurrency = 81
  - liquidationThreshold = 80%
  - liquidationBonus = 125%
- **Debt Recovery Calculation:** The maximum debt that can be recovered is from 100 collateral is 80;
- Deficit: The remaining debt is:
totalDebtInBaseCurrency − recoverableDebt = 81 − 80 = 1


### Impact

- The protocol incurs more deficits from incomplete liquidation. and hence more deficit to eliminate

### Mitigation

Edit the `validateLiquidationCall` function
```diff
- require(
-      params.healthFactor < HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD,
-      Errors.HEALTH_FACTOR_NOT_BELOW_THRESHOLD
-    );

+require(
+     params.healthFactor <= HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD,
+      Errors.HEALTH_FACTOR_NOT_BELOW_THRESHOLD
+    );
```
