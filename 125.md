# borrower can bypass bad debt protection by depositing very small amounts of collateral in reserve

### Summary

a borrower can grief the system by depositing dust in a reserve as collateral,
eg the user purposely deposits 3 usd worth of collateral in a reserve 
if the borrowers position is in bad debt and is being liquidated, because the users total collateral would not match collateral in liquidated reserve, the user debt technically cannot be included in the reserves deficit but realistically, the debt would not be repaid and its not economical for liquidators to liquidate the remaining collateral 
leaving the remaining debt continuing to accrue interest

### Root Cause

1. liquidations only work with one collateral reserve at a time 
2. There is no minimum aToken balance a user could have in a reserve 
3. a borrower must have lost all collateral before the bad debt removal functionality can work

### Attack Path

### Impact

the borrower would be left with dust collateral and debt that cannot be covered via the eliminate deficit functionality defeating the purpose of the upgrade 

### PoC

in base currency
bob has 
3000 debt 
2700 in reserve a
3 in reserve b

bob would lose his entire 2700 position when reserve a is liquidated but because 2703 != 2700 , the system will not attempt to add bobs debt to the reserves deficit 

### Mitigation

1. open up possibilities for the liquidator to collect tokens from more than one reserve if the borrowers collateral in that reserve is at a range where it would no longer be profitable to liquidate that reserve on its own, the MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD which was included in this update could also be used 
eg 
bob has 7000 debt in base currency 
6000 as collateral in reserve a 
100 as collateral in reserve b

rather than the liquidator only being get collateral from reserve a, they could also get the collateral from reserve b in the same call 
this is not exactly profitable for the liquidator either as the bonus from the 100 would likely not be able to cover the gas costs but it would still be better than liquidating the 100 reserve individually and should increase the likelihood of liquidators wanting to clean up the position even if it might mean less profit from them 

2. implement a clean up functionality for positions with bad health factor and only dust collateral left to be immediately included in the deficit and the protocol can claim whatever little collateral they have
