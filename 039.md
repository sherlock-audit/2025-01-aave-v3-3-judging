# Lack of Insufficient Balance Validation in withdrawETH Function

**Severity:** High
**Likelihood:** High
**Impact:** High

**Affected Line of Code:**  https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/helpers/WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol#L55-L68

### Summary
The `withdrawETH` function in `WrappedTokenGatewayV3` does not validate the amount parameter, allowing users to request more funds than their balance. This leads to a Solidity panic error (0x11), which causes a denial of service (DoS) for users and results in unnecessary gas consumption.

### Finding Description
The `withdrawETH` function directly uses the `amount` parameter without checking whether it exceeds the user's balance. The issue arises at the following code:

```solidity

aWETH.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountToWithdraw);
```
If the requested withdrawal amount exceeds the user's balance, the `transferFrom` function will revert due to an arithmetic overflow or underflow, causing a panic (0x11). This flaw breaks the expected behavior, leading to disrupted user experience and wasted gas fees. A malicious user could potentially exploit this vulnerability by repeatedly trying invalid withdrawals, which would lead to DoS and unnecessary gas costs for other users.

### Impact Explanation
***Impact on Users:***
Users attempting to withdraw more than their balance will encounter failed transactions, resulting in wasted gas fees and a frustrating experience. This is especially problematic if the user isn’t aware of their balance limitations.

***Impact on Protocol:***
The protocol's reliability is compromised, and it risks eroding user trust. This could also lead to increased transaction costs, especially if malicious actors attempt to exploit this vulnerability, causing a DoS effect.

***Likelihood Explanation***
This issue is highly likely, given that the `withdrawETH` function is a core feature frequently used in interactions with the contract. Without sufficient validation, even accidental misuse could lead to reverts. Furthermore, a malicious user could intentionally trigger repeated failed transactions, leading to higher gas costs and potential denial of service for others.

### Proof of Concept (PoC)
The following test case demonstrates the issue:

```solidity

function testWithdrawEthFromWrappedTokenGateway() public {
    // Deposit ETH
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    wrappedTokenGatewayV3.depositETH{value: depositSize}(address(0), alice, 0);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Over-withdrawal test
    uint256 withdrawalAmount = depositSize + 1e18; // Exceeds deposit
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    vm.expectRevert("Insufficient funds for withdrawal");
    wrappedTokenGatewayV3.withdrawETH(address(0), withdrawalAmount, alice);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Valid withdrawal test
    uint256 validWithdrawalAmount = depositSize / 2;
    vm.startPrank(alice);
    wrappedTokenGatewayV3.withdrawETH(address(0), validWithdrawalAmount, alice);
    vm.stopPrank();

    // Validate balances
    uint256 remainingBalance = depositSize - validWithdrawalAmount;
    assertEq(aWEth.balanceOf(alice), remainingBalance, "Incorrect remaining balance");
}
```
***Test Result:***

```solidity

Ran 1 test for tests/foundry/WrappedTokenGatewayV3.t.sol:WrappedTokenGatewayTests  
[FAIL: Error != expected error: panic: arithmetic underflow or overflow (0x11) != Insufficient funds for withdrawal]  
testWithdrawEthFromWrappedTokenGateway() (gas: 270983)
```
### Recommendation
To prevent this issue, a validation check should be added to ensure the requested withdrawal amount does not exceed the user’s balance before executing the `transferFrom` function. A revert message like "Insufficient funds for withdrawal" should be included to provide a clear feedback mechanism.

***Fixed Code Snippet***
```solidity
function withdrawETH(address, uint256 amount, address to) external override {
    IAToken aWETH = IAToken(POOL.getReserveAToken(address(WETH)));
    uint256 userBalance = aWETH.balanceOf(msg.sender);
    uint256 amountToWithdraw = amount;

    if (amount == type(uint256).max) {  
        amountToWithdraw = userBalance;  
    }  

    // Validate that the user has sufficient balance  
    require(amountToWithdraw <= userBalance, "Insufficient funds for withdrawal");  

    aWETH.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountToWithdraw);  
    POOL.withdraw(address(WETH), amountToWithdraw, address(this));  
    WETH.withdraw(amountToWithdraw);  
    _safeTransferETH(to, amountToWithdraw);  
}
```
This fix ensures that the `withdrawETH` function validates the `amount` parameter, preventing reverts and preserving the protocol’s functionality.
