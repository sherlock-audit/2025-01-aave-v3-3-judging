# Failing to strictly verify whether there is sufficient available liquidity in the pool before approving a loan.

### Summary

In the validateBorrow function, the code only checks:
```solidity
require(
  !params.reserveCache.reserveConfiguration.getIsVirtualAccActive() ||
    IERC20(params.reserveCache.aTokenAddress).totalSupply() >= params.amount,
  Errors.INVALID_AMOUNT
);
```
to determine whether borrowing is allowed. However, it fails to properly check whether there is actually enough available liquidity in the pool to support the requested loan. The function aToken.totalSupply() represents the total issued supply of aTokens, not the actual available liquidity of the underlying asset.

### Root Cause

In Aave’s design, aToken.totalSupply() primarily reflects the total deposits across all users (converted into aToken shares)—but this does not guarantee that the same amount of the underlying asset remains unborrowed. A significant portion of the deposited assets may have already been borrowed by other users. The actual available liquidity should be calculated as the remaining unborrowed balance of the underlying asset, rather than just relying on the aToken supply.

If the check is simply:
```solidity
IERC20(params.reserveCache.aTokenAddress).totalSupply() >= params.amount
```
this does not prevent the pool from being drained of liquidity. In theory, even if most of the pool’s assets have already been borrowed, this condition could still pass validation, allowing new borrowers to proceed while actual liquidity is insufficient. This could lead to situations where the protocol approves loans that cannot be fulfilled due to a lack of available funds.

The correct approach would be to check available liquidity before allowing a loan, such as by verifying:
The remaining balance of the underlying asset (availableLiquidity) is greater than or equal to params.amount;
Or implementing a similar availableLiquidity >= amount check at a higher level in Aave’s logic.

Even missing a basic “is there enough liquidity left?” check can introduce serious financial risks.

### Mitigation

The usual method is to retrieve:
```solidity
availableLiquidity = IERC20(asset).balanceOf(aTokenAddress);
```
Then validate:
```solidity
require(availableLiquidity >= amount, Errors.VL_NOT_ENOUGH_AVAILABLE_USER_BALANCE);
```
This ensures that the borrower can actually withdraw the requested amount of the underlying asset.
