# Unchecked Return Value of IERC20.safeTransferFrom

## Summary  

The `executeBackUnbacked` function in the `BridgeLogic` contract uses `IERC20.safeTransferFrom` to transfer tokens without explicitly checking the return value. While `GPv2SafeERC20` is employed to enforce safety checks, certain improperly implemented or malicious ERC20 tokens may bypass these checks, leading to unexpected behavior or potential token losses.

---

## Description  

The `GPv2SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom` function wraps `IERC20.safeTransferFrom` to handle potential issues with token transfers (e.g., by reverting on failure). However, the implementation of `GPv2SafeERC20` does not guarantee proper functionality with non-standard or poorly implemented ERC20 tokens. If an improperly implemented token fails to execute the transfer as expected, the absence of an explicit return value check may result in undetected token losses.

The relevant code is found in the following lines:

```solidity
IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, reserveCache.aTokenAddress, added);
```

Without explicit validation of the successful token transfer, this operation may fail silently, potentially leading to discrepancies between the intended and actual token balances.

---

## Root Cause  

The root cause of this vulnerability is the implicit reliance on the `GPv2SafeERC20.safeTransferFrom` function to handle transfer failures, which does not account for non-compliant ERC20 implementations. The following line in the `executeBackUnbacked` function is affected:

## Impact  

This issue may result in the following consequences:  
- Token transfers may silently fail when interacting with non-standard ERC20 tokens, potentially causing token losses.  
- Critical financial operations within the protocol may behave unexpectedly, leading to inconsistencies in reserve and liquidity management.  
- Potentially exploitable scenarios for malicious tokens.

---

## Proof of Concept (PoC)

To demonstrate the vulnerability, consider an ERC20 token implementation that does not return a boolean value for the `transferFrom` function or reverts silently:

### Malicious ERC20 Token Example  
```solidity
contract MaliciousToken is IERC20 {
    function transferFrom(address, address, uint256) external override returns (bool) {
        // Fails without revert or returns false, bypassing checks
        return false;
    }
}
```

### Exploit Scenario  
1. Deploy the `MaliciousToken` and mint tokens to an attacker-controlled address.  
2. Call the `executeBackUnbacked` function using `MaliciousToken` as the asset.  
3. The `safeTransferFrom` operation will fail silently, and the protocol will assume tokens were transferred successfully, leading to accounting discrepancies or lost tokens.

---

## Mitigation  

To address this issue, explicitly validate the successful completion of the token transfer. Use a require statement to enforce the correct return value:

### Mitigated Code  
```solidity
require(
    IERC20(asset).safeTransferFrom(msg.sender, reserveCache.aTokenAddress, added),
    "Token transfer failed"
);
```
--- 

This approach ensures that any failure in the token transfer process is detected and handled appropriately, preventing silent failures and token losses.
