# Malicious actors will cause economic damage through view function manipulation affecting user positions

### Summary

The external calls loop vulnerability will cause financial losses for users as attackers can manipulate view functions during critical market conditions to block liquidations and exploit price movements.


### Root Cause

In src/contracts/helpers/AaveProtocolDataProvider.sol#39-58 (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/helpers/AaveProtocolDataProvider.sol#L39-L58) the choice to make uncached external calls in view functions is a mistake as these functions are critical for liquidation and borrowing operations


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User position needs to action collateral ratio to be at most liquidation threshold
2. Market price needs to change position value to go from safe to unsafe within 1 block


### External Pre-conditions

1. Market conditions need to be volatile enough to make liquidations profitable
2. At least one reserve token must be controlled by the attacker


### Attack Path

1. Attacker deploys malicious token and gets it listed as reserve
2. Attacker monitors for liquidatable positions
3. When found, attacker toggles their token's symbol() function to revert
4. Legitimate liquidators fail to execute liquidations due to view function failures
5. Attacker manipulates price while others are blocked
6. Attacker restores token functionality and liquidates at better price

### Impact

1. The affected users suffer losses of up to 100% of their liquidation bonus
2. The attacker gains the difference between normal liquidation bonus and manipulated price
3. Example: For a $100,000 position with 10% liquidation bonus, attacker could gain extra $5,000-$10,000 through price manipulation



### PoC

```solidity
function testLiquidationBlockingAttack() public {
    // Setup liquidation scenario
    pool.setPrice(address(maliciousToken), 100 ether);
    pool.isLiquidatable = true;
    
    // Simulate market conditions where liquidation should happen
    vm.prank(victim);
    assertTrue(pool.checkLiquidation(), "Should be liquidatable");
    
    // Attacker blocks liquidation by making view function fail
    vm.prank(attacker);
    maliciousToken.toggleRevert();
    
    // Liquidation check fails due to view function failure
    vm.prank(victim);
    vm.expectRevert();
    pool.checkLiquidation();
    
    // Attacker manipulates price
    pool.setPrice(address(maliciousToken), 90 ether);
    
    // Restore state and liquidate at favorable price
    maliciousToken.toggleRevert();
    vm.prank(attacker);
    assertTrue(pool.checkLiquidation(), "Attacker can liquidate");
}
```

### Mitigation

1. Implement view function result caching
2. Add circuit breakers for suspicious token behavior
3. Separate critical operations from view function dependencies
4. Implement priority lanes for liquidations
