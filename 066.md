# Allowing partial liquidations when all of user's collateral balance will be consumed will create false bad debts.

### Summary

`actualDebtToLiquidate` will not == `userReserveDebt` in partial liquidations even when all of user's collateral balance will be consumed in the liquidation

### Root Cause

The root cause of this issue is that whenever `vars.totalCollateralInBaseCurrency` == `vars.collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency` in `LiquidationLogic.executeLiquidationCall()`, `hasNoCollateralLeft` is set to true

```solidity
 bool hasNoCollateralLeft = vars.totalCollateralInBaseCurrency ==
      vars.collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency;
```

Now when `_burnDebtTokens()` is called and `hasNoCollateralLeft` is true, _all of user's debt is burnt_ (`userReserveDebt`).

```solidity
  function _burnDebtTokens(
    DataTypes.ReserveCache memory debtReserveCache,
    DataTypes.ReserveData storage debtReserve,
    DataTypes.UserConfigurationMap storage userConfig,
    address user,
    address debtAsset,
    uint256 userReserveDebt,
    uint256 actualDebtToLiquidate,
    bool hasNoCollateralLeft
  ) internal {
    // Prior v3.1, there were cases where, after liquidation, the `isBorrowing` flag was left on
    // even after the user debt was fully repaid, so to avoid this function reverting in the `_burnScaled`
    // (see ScaledBalanceTokenBase contract), we check for any debt remaining.
    if (userReserveDebt != 0) {
      debtReserveCache.nextScaledVariableDebt = IVariableDebtToken(
        debtReserveCache.variableDebtTokenAddress
      ).burn(
          user,
          hasNoCollateralLeft ? userReserveDebt : actualDebtToLiquidate,//@audit
          debtReserveCache.nextVariableBorrowIndex
        );
    }

```
The issue lies in how `outstandingDebt` is calculated.
```solidity
 uint256 outstandingDebt = userReserveDebt - actualDebtToLiquidate;//@audit-issue partial liquidations can create false bad debts. (happens if partial liquidations is attempted on a user whose whole collateral will be consumed on liquidation.) 
``` 
if liquidation is a partial one, `actualDebtToLiquidate` which is liquidator's specified debt to cover won't == `userReserveDebt`. Now although all of user's debt(`userReserveDebt`) was burnt and taken care of, `outstandingDebt` will !=0 which is wrong. 

The wrong and false `outstandingDebt` will be added to  `debtReserve.deficit`

**Here's a more vivid explanation:**
- Total of Ben's debt(userReserveDebt) is == 1000$

- Ben's position is liquidatable, so i decide to liquidate 500$ for him.(actualDebtToLiquidate) (Partial liquidation)

- Now the liquidation will consume all of Ben's collateral, so `hasNoCollateralLeft` is set to true

- when `_burnDebtTokens()` is called, since hasNoCollateralLeft is true, Ben's 1000$ is burnt
```solidity
if (userReserveDebt != 0) {
      debtReserveCache.nextScaledVariableDebt = IVariableDebtToken(
        debtReserveCache.variableDebtTokenAddress
      ).burn(
          user,
          hasNoCollateralLeft ? userReserveDebt : actualDebtToLiquidate,//@audit
          debtReserveCache.nextVariableBorrowIndex
        );
```

- When `outstandingDebt` is calculated, my 500$(actualDebtToLiquidate) is deducted from the Total of Ben's debt(userReserveDebt) which is 1000$.. leaving `outstandingDebt` as 500$ when in reality the whole 1000$ was burnt.



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. `vars.totalCollateralInBaseCurrency` needs to == `vars.collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency` in `LiquidationLogic.executeLiquidationCall()`, so `hasNoCollateralLeft` is set to true


### External Pre-conditions

1. Liquidation needs to be a partial liquidation.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Allowing partial liquidations when all of user's collateral balance will be consumed will create false bad debts.

This will make Umbrella lose money by spending it on eliminating false bad debts and reserve deficits

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

whenever  liquidations will consume all of user's collateral balance don't allow partial liquidations
