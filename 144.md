# executeLiquidationCall()

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L200
If we closely examine the following logic in executeLiquidationCall():
```solidity
bool hasNoCollateralLeft = vars.totalCollateralInBaseCurrency == 
  vars.collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency;
if (hasNoCollateralLeft && userConfig.isBorrowingAny()) {
  _burnBadDebt(...);
}
```
we can see that it relies on a strict equality check (==) to determine whether the user has no remaining collateral after liquidation.

However, both
vars.totalCollateralInBaseCurrency and
vars.collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency
are derived from calculations involving prices, indexes, and discount rates, which often introduce floating-point precision or rounding issues. In real-world scenarios, even if a user’s collateral is nearly fully liquidated, small rounding discrepancies may prevent vars.totalCollateralInBaseCurrency from being exactly equal to vars.collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency. Instead, there may be a minuscule “dust” amount remaining. As a result, the hasNoCollateralLeft check fails, preventing the _burnBadDebt() logic from executing. This leaves behind residual “dust collateral,” keeping the user in a state where isBorrowingAny = true and making full liquidation impossible—creating a deadlock scenario.

Specific Issues
	1.	Minimal Residual Collateral
When a user is left with an extremely small amount of collateral, precision errors can cause totalCollateralInBaseCurrency to retain a tiny nonzero value, while collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency might be slightly less due to rounding. This makes the == comparison return false, leading the protocol to incorrectly assume the user still has collateral, even when it is practically worthless.
	2.	Bad Debt Fails to Trigger
In Aave, _burnBadDebt() is only executed if the user’s collateral is truly zero. However, if the strict equality check fails due to rounding errors, the _burnBadDebt() function is never called, creating a risk where actual bad debt goes unregistered or results in a “zombie” debt position.
	3.	User’s Future Actions Are Blocked
Because a tiny amount of collateral and debt remains, the user may be unable to manually repay their debt, nor can liquidators fully clear the position (due to Dust logic or Close Factor constraints). As a result, the position remains stuck, causing difficulties for both the protocol and the user.

Potential Fixes

To prevent this issue, a common approach when comparing floating-point or fixed-point numbers is to avoid strict equality (==) and instead use:
	A Small Tolerance Threshold
Example:
```solidity
// Assume we consider any amount below 1 wei of base currency as "no collateral left"
if (vars.totalCollateralInBaseCurrency <= vars.collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency + 1) {
    hasNoCollateralLeft = true;
}
```
Alternatively, a more appropriate epsilon value can be chosen for approximate comparisons.

Consistent Rounding Methods
During collateral sum calculations and liquidation amount conversions, ensure that a consistent rounding direction is applied across all operations to eliminate rounding mismatches.
	More Robust Dust Logic
Since Aave already has a MIN_LEFTOVER_BASE mechanism (which enforces full liquidation unless a meaningful amount of collateral remains), a simple fix is to modify the “has collateral left” check to also account for whether the remaining value is below MIN_LEFTOVER_BASE. This would ensure that dust amounts are treated as effectively zero, allowing _burnBadDebt() to proceed.

Regardless of the specific fix chosen, the core principle remains the same: Avoid using == to compare numbers that may have floating-point or precision discrepancies, especially in liquidation processes where large sums of money and internal price calculations are involved. Otherwise, “dust positions” may accumulate, preventing full liquidation and creating a systemic vulnerability.
