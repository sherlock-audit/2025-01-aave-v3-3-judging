# Hardcoded Token Addresses in Protocol Data Provider Create Cross-Chain Deployment Risks

### Summary

The AaveProtocolDataProvider contract contains a critical architectural flaw in its implementation of token address handling. At its core, the contract hardcodes Ethereum mainnet addresses for specific tokens:

```solidity
address constant MKR = 0x9f8F72aA9304c8B593d555F12eF6589cC3A579A2;
address constant ETH = 0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE;
```

This design fundamentally contradicts Aave V3's architectural vision of cross-chain operability. The Portal feature, a cornerstone of Aave V3's cross-chain functionality, enables seamless liquidity flows between networks. However, the hardcoded mainnet addresses create a significant disconnect between this design goal and its implementation.

The implications cascade through multiple layers of the protocol. When deployed on L2s or alternative networks, these hardcoded addresses become invalid, breaking the protocol's ability to properly identify and process these tokens. 

The contract's rigid architecture extends beyond cross-chain limitations. It makes critical assumptions about token behavior, particularly regarding the implementation of standard interfaces. The special case handling assumes MKR and ETH lack standard `symbol()` functions:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/helpers/AaveProtocolDataProvider.sol#L39

```solidity
if (reserves[i] == MKR) {
    reservesTokens[i] = TokenData({symbol: 'MKR', tokenAddress: reserves[i]});
    continue;
}
```

This static implementation fails to account for the dynamic nature of smart contract protocols, where token implementations might be upgraded or modified. In the event of token contract upgrades or migrations on mainnet, the hardcoded addresses would require a full contract redeployment - a significant operational burden that contradicts Aave's commitment to protocol maintainability and upgradeability.

The ramifications of this design choice extend beyond the immediate protocol infrastructure. It impacts the broader DeFi ecosystem, potentially disrupting protocols that integrate with Aave and rely on accurate data from this provider. The lack of flexibility in token address management creates a brittle system that's increasingly difficult to maintain as the protocol expands across networks.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1. Implement a registry pattern for special case tokens:
```solidity
mapping(address => TokenData) public specialCaseTokens;

function setSpecialCaseToken(address token, string memory symbol) external onlyAdmin {
    specialCaseTokens[token] = TokenData({
        symbol: symbol,
        tokenAddress: token
    });
}
```

2. Modify `getAllReservesTokens()` to use the registry:
```solidity
function getAllReservesTokens() external view override returns (TokenData[] memory) {
    IPool pool = IPool(ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.getPool());
    address[] memory reserves = pool.getReservesList();
    TokenData[] memory reservesTokens = new TokenData[](reserves.length);
    
    for (uint256 i = 0; i < reserves.length; i++) {
        // Check special cases first
        if (specialCaseTokens[reserves[i]].tokenAddress != address(0)) {
            reservesTokens[i] = specialCaseTokens[reserves[i]];
            continue;
        }
        
        // Try standard ERC20 interface
        try IERC20Detailed(reserves[i]).symbol() returns (string memory symbol) {
            reservesTokens[i] = TokenData({
                symbol: symbol,
                tokenAddress: reserves[i]
            });
        } catch {
            reservesTokens[i] = TokenData({
                symbol: "UNKNOWN",
                tokenAddress: reserves[i]
            });
        }
    }
    return reservesTokens;
}
```
