# WrappedTokenGatewayV3 will force users into variable-rate debt positions for ETH, causing financial losses for borrowers

### Summary

The hardcoded InterestRateMode.VARIABLE in WrappedTokenGatewayV3’s repayETH and borrowETH functions will cause a loss of financial flexibility for ETH borrowers. Users are forced into variable-rate debt even when stable rates are preferable, leading to higher interest costs or liquidation risks.

> Aave Protocol Design : Aave V3 Technical Paper explicitly states that users can choose between stable and variable rates

Conceptual Mistake: The choice to hardcode VARIABLE is a mistake because it violates Aave’s core design, which allows users to choose between stable and variable rates. This forces users into suboptimal debt strategies.

Affected Party: ETH borrowers using the gateway.
Actor: Users interacting with WrappedTokenGatewayV3.
Attack Path: Users cannot repay or borrow ETH in stable-rate mode via the gateway, forcing them into variable-rate positions that may become unsustainable.

### Root Cause

In [WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol:88](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/helpers/WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol#L88) The repayETH function hardcodes InterestRateMode.VARIABLE, ignoring stable-rate debt :

```solidity
POOL.repay(..., uint256(DataTypes.InterestRateMode.VARIABLE), ...);
```

In [WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol:105](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/helpers/WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol#L105) The borrowETH function hardcodes InterestRateMode.VARIABLE :

```solidity
POOL.borrow(..., uint256(DataTypes.InterestRateMode.VARIABLE), ...);  
```



### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1- User borrows ETH via borrowETH:
The gateway forces the user into variable-rate debt, even if stable rates are cheaper.

2- User attempts to repay stable-rate debt via repayETH:
The gateway only repays variable-rate debt, leaving stable-rate debt untouched.

3- Stable-rate debt accrues interest:
The user’s stable-rate debt remains unpaid, leading to liquidation.

### Impact

Affected Party: Users suffer direct financial loss from unmanaged stable-rate debt (e.g., liquidation penalties).
Loss Value: Up to 100% of the stable-rate debt position (if liquidated).

        address user = makeAddr("user");
        vm.prank(user);
        IPool(pool).borrow(address(WETH), 1e18, 1, 0, user); // 1 = STABLE mode

        // 2. User tries to repay via WrappedTokenGatewayV3
        vm.prank(user);
        wrappedGateway.repayETH{value: 1e18}(0, 1e18, user); // Fails to repay stable debt
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

1- Add an interestRateMode parameter to repayETH and borrowETH in WrappedTokenGatewayV3.
2- Remove hardcoding of VARIABLE and pass the user’s selected mode to the Pool.
