# Debt Unit Mismatch Leading to Dust Accumulation

## Summary and Impact

This vulnerability arises when the protocol internally stores and processes debt with a different scale than the standard 18-decimal ERC20 format. Specifically, the system might represent a debt amount like `0.35e18` as an integer `35`, never converting it back before performing repay logic. As a result, a portion of the user’s debt, referred to as “dust,” remains even after a full repay or liquidation.  

**Why It Matters**:  
- **Accounting Errors**: Users are left with a nonzero residual balance, violating the protocol’s core invariant that a complete repay should reset debt to zero.  
- **Inconsistent User Status**: A user expecting a fully settled loan is still flagged as a borrower, potentially blocking further actions (e.g., withdrawing collateral).  
- **Potential Under-/Over-Repayment**: If the mismatch is large enough, the protocol may lose revenue (under-repayment) or users might overpay, suffering from a silent loss.  

In the project’s documentation, the protocol emphasizes robust debt accounting and the importance of consistent user states. This mismatch undermines those assumptions, making it a **medium**-severity issue: impactful enough to cause ongoing accounting confusion, yet not catastrophic in a single transaction.

## Vulnerability Details

This bug resides in how the protocol interprets debt amounts that have been scaled down or up for interest accrual. When it should re-scale them back to the standard `18-decimal` representation, the code omits this step, leaving a fractional remainder (dust).

1. **Mismatched Scaling**: The protocol uses internal integer representations (e.g., `35`) to denote what should be `0.35e18` tokens.  
2. **Unconverted During Repay**: When a user repays, the code does not re-scale `35` back to `0.35e18`, resulting in leftover dust.  
3. **Ongoing Flag**: Users continue to appear as borrowers due to that dust. Even if it’s a tiny fraction, it conflicts with the documentation stating a full repay resets the debt balance to zero.

### Code Snippet

Consider a snippet of **`BorrowLogic.sol -> executeRepay()`** where the protocol calculates the repayment amount but never transforms it back to the correct 18-decimal format:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L154-L234


**Root Cause**: If `variableDebt` is an integer storing scaled “partial decimals,” it doesn’t match the user’s actual 18-decimal debt. The leftover dust prevents a zero-out.

#### Test Code Snippet

Below is a compressed Foundry test that demonstrates the mismatch. After a borrow of an amount like `333333333000000000` (333.333333 tokens) and a repay, the leftover debt remains:

```solidity
function testDustRepayment() public {
  // 1) Borrow an odd decimal amount
  uint256 oddAmount = 333333333000000000; // 333.333333 tokens
  // (Borrow logic omitted for brevity)

  // 2) Attempt full repay
  // repay(asset, oddAmount, VARIABLE_RATE, user);

  // 3) Check leftover dust
  uint256 leftover = getUserVariableDebt(user);
  require(leftover > 0, "Dust mismatch not reproduced!");
}
```

**Step-by-Step**:  
1. The user borrows a non-round debt amount that cannot neatly divide by the scaling factor.  
2. A subsequent repay attempts to pay off everything.  
3. Internally, the system remains with an integer remainder—thus “dust” leftover.  
4. The user remains flagged as having a debt.

This breaks the protocol’s expectation that a user with no further borrow intentions should have a debt of exactly zero.

## Recommendations

1. **Re-Scale All Repay Amounts**  
   - Before invoking `burn(...)`, ensure the protocol interprets the user’s debt in the correct 18-decimal format.  
   - For instance, if the internal value `35` represents `0.35e18`, convert it back before passing it to the debt-token contract.

2. **Post-Repay Dust Check**  
   - After the `burn` operation, if the leftover debt is below a minimal threshold (`1 wei` or another small epsilon in scaled form), set it to zero. This ensures that minor rounding does not linger.
