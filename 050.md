# Incorrect handling of partially liquidated isolated reserves can break debt ceiling enforcement.

### **Summary**  
After a partial liquidation in an isolated reserve, the system does not properly adjust the isolation mode debt tracking to reflect the reduced debt, leading to potential breaches of the debt ceiling in future operations.

---

### **Root Cause**  
In `LiquidationLogic.sol` (within `executeLiquidationCall`), the function [IsolationModeLogic.updateIsolatedDebtIfIsolated](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L373-L379) is called only after the liquidation is complete, but it does not accurately reflect the reduced `actualDebtToLiquidate` [during partial liquidations](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L366). The `isolationModeTotalDebt` remains unchanged or improperly updated, causing inaccuracies in debt ceiling enforcement.

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**  
1. A reserve is configured as isolated with an active debt ceiling (`reserveConfiguration.getIsolated()` is `true`).  
2. The user’s position is partially liquidated (`actualDebtToLiquidate < userReserveDebt`).  
3. `IsolationModeLogic.updateIsolatedDebtIfIsolated` fails to properly adjust the reserve’s `isolationModeTotalDebt`.

---

### **External Pre-conditions**  
None (assumes no external dependencies on this logic).

---

### **Attack Path**  
1. A user with an isolated reserve is partially liquidated.  
2. The protocol does not properly adjust the `isolationModeTotalDebt` for the isolated reserve after the partial liquidation.  
3. Future borrowing or liquidations proceed, assuming the outdated `isolationModeTotalDebt`.  
4. The debt ceiling is unintentionally exceeded due to stale tracking.

---

### **Impact**  
The protocol’s isolation mode guarantees are broken, potentially leading to over-leverage within isolated reserves. This could expose the entire protocol to systemic risks that isolation mode was designed to contain.

---

### **Mitigation**  
Ensure `IsolationModeLogic.updateIsolatedDebtIfIsolated` accurately subtracts `actualDebtToLiquidate` from the `isolationModeTotalDebt` during partial liquidations.
