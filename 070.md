# Improper Use of `uint256` for Booleans

### **Summary**  
Certain functions (`setActive`, `setFrozen`, and `setPaused`) use `uint256` variables to represent boolean values. This design choice introduces potential risks as values other than `0` or `1` can lead to unexpected behavior. Specifically, invalid values such as `2` or other non-zero integers could cause logical errors in the contract.  


### **Description**  
The ReserveConfiguration contract utilizes `uint256` variables to represent boolean states, which is unnecessary and introduces risk. For instance, the following logic is applied to set the state of the `active` flag:  
```solidity
(uint256(active ? 1 : 0) << IS_ACTIVE_START_BIT_POSITION);
```
The use of a `uint256` here for a boolean is not only non-intuitive but can lead to issues where the value is mistakenly set to something other than `0` or `1`. A malicious actor or a logical flaw in the contract could exploit this design choice, leading to unexpected outcomes or undefined behavior.


### **Root Cause**  
Improper representation of boolean states using `uint256` variables.  

**Line of Code (LoC) where it occurs:**  
```solidity
(uint256(active ? 1 : 0) << IS_ACTIVE_START_BIT_POSITION);
```

Affected functions:  
i, `setActive`
ii, `setFrozen`
iii,  `setPaused`

### **Impact**  
The primary impact of this issue is undefined or unexpected behavior of the contract when invalid values (e.g., `2` or greater) are used for state flags. This could result in:  
i, Incorrect state transitions.
ii,  Logical flaws in the execution of dependent functions.  
iii, Potential vulnerabilities for malicious actors to exploit the unexpected behavior of the contract.  


### **Proof of Concept (PoC)**  
Below is a simplified demonstration of the potential issue:  
```solidity
contract StateTest {
    uint256 public state;

    function setActive(uint256 value) public {
        // Expecting only 0 or 1, but no validation is done
        state = value;
    }

    function isActive() public view returns (bool) {
        // Returns true for any non-zero value, including invalid ones like 2
        return state != 0;
    }
}

// PoC
StateTest test = new StateTest();
test.setActive(2); // Invalid value
require(test.isActive() == true, "Invalid state accepted");
```


### **Recommended Mitigation**  
To avoid this issue, it is recommended to explicitly use the `bool` type for boolean flags instead of `uint256`. This approach eliminates the risk of invalid values being used.  

Example mitigation:  
```solidity
function setActive(bool active) public {
    uint256 state = active ? 1 : 0;
    // Use explicit boolean checks
}
```

Additionally, the contract should:  
1. Validate input values for functions that depend on these flags to ensure only `0` or `1` is accepted.  
2. Add consistent comments explaining the bit layout and purpose of each mask for clarity and maintainability.
