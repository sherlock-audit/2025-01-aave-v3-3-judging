# DoS when user want to supply / repay asset using a permit

### Summary

The Asset ERC20 token of the Pool contract incorporates the [[EIP-2612 permit](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612)](https://eips.ethereum.org/EIPS/eip-2612), allowing users to off-chain sign permits for gas-less transfers. However, the open Zeppelin's design choice introduces a frontrunning risk, where any entity can execute the `permit()` function before the original transaction, causing potential issues, especially when used within other functions.

### Root Cause

These functions [supplyWithPermit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/pool/Pool.sol#L165) and [repayWithPermit()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/pool/Pool.sol#L274) in a `Pool.sol` contract on callable by user for supply collateralls or repay.

An malicious user can extract the `permitV - permitR - permitS` parameters from the functions call and frontruns it with a direct permit() in `asset` token. In this case, the end result is harmful, since the user loses the functionality that follows the `permit()`.

In fact, any function call that unconditionally performs `permit()` can be forced to revert this way. In case there is a fallback code path (using direct user approval), the `DOS` is short-term, as eventually the user / dApp would switch to using an alternative. Otherwise, the `DOS` is long-term.

### External Pre-conditions

### Attack Path

1. Alice sign the tx off-chain and submit it to perform `supplyWithPermit` or `repayWithPermit`
2. While the Alice tx is in mempool, Bob `(Attacker)` can see it, frontrun it, and execute `permit` directly on the underlying token with all the message and signature details of Alice.
3. Alice's tx now executes after Bob's tx and it will get reverted as the signature is already used.


### Impact

This would cause the user to lose money for sending the transaction, but later with a new signature, the user would be able to call the function once again to complete it. In this instance, the attacker damaged the user by requiring them to send another transaction. The attacker does not profit, but they do damage the users or the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

In `supplyWithPermit()` and `repayWithPermit()` functions, check if it has the approval it needs. If not, then only submit the permit signature:

```solidity
if (IERC20(address(asset)).allowance(msg.sender,address(this)) < amount) {
            try
      IERC20WithPermit(asset).permit(
        msg.sender,
        address(this),
        amount,
        deadline,
        permitV,
        permitR,
        permitS
      )
    {} catch {}
        }
```
