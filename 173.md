# Handling of params.amount in executeRepay function

#Description

#Summary
In the https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L154 function, the logic for determining https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L176 could lead to issues if https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L179 is set to is set to type(uint256).max and the user has less debt than that.

#Vulnerability details
The vulnerability arises in the following part of the function:
if (params.useATokens && params.amount == type(uint256).max) {
  params.amount = IAToken(reserveCache.aTokenAddress).balanceOf(msg.sender);
}
When params.amount is set to type(uint256).max (a common sentinel value indicating "repay as much as possible"), the logic overrides params.amount with the aToken balance of msg.sender.
The function subsequently calculates paybackAmount as the smaller of params.amount and variableDebt.
If the user's aToken balance is less than their actual variableDebt, they won't repay their full debt, leaving residual debt (variableDebt - paybackAmount).
Since the residual debt might be small (e.g., due to rounding errors or interest accumulation), the user may incorrectly believe they've fully repaid their debt, leading to unexpected outcomes.

#Impact

User Confusion:
Users may think they have repaid their entire debt if they provided type(uint256).max, but residual debt remains due to insufficient aToken balance.
This could lead to penalties, additional interest accrual, or unintended actions like liquidation in case of collateralized positions.

Financial Risks:
Residual debt may cause issues for protocols relying on precise debt management, affecting solvency metrics or reserve balance tracking.

State Inconsistency:
Residual debt might not align with the protocol's expectations, potentially leading to discrepancies in accounting or logic downstream.

Manual review

#Mitigation
Enforce Explicit Debt Repayment:
If params.amount == type(uint256).max, explicitly calculate paybackAmount as the full variableDebt, irrespective of the aToken balance:
uint256 maxRepayableAmount = params.useATokens 
  ? IAToken(reserveCache.aTokenAddress).balanceOf(msg.sender)
  : variableDebt;
paybackAmount = params.amount < maxRepayableAmount ? params.amount : maxRepayableAmount;

Validate params.amount Against Debt:
Add a validation step to ensure params.amount does not exceed variableDebt:
require(params.amount <= variableDebt, "Repay amount exceeds outstanding debt");

Emit Residual Debt Events:
If residual debt remains, emit an event to notify the user and provide clear feedback:
if (variableDebt - paybackAmount > 0) {
  emit ResidualDebt(params.asset, params.onBehalfOf, variableDebt - paybackAmount);
}
