# Reserve cannot be initialised for same token on different chains

### Summary

There is an edge case when a user with a healthFactor over 0.95 can be 100% liquidated with two attacer transactions. 

### Root Cause

According to the contest description, the protocol should work on the following chains: Ethereum, Base, Arbitrum, Avalanche, Optimism, Polygon, Metis, Gnosis, BNB chain, Scroll, Zksync Era. In some cases there may be a problem initialising a reserve for some tokens. 

A new reserve can be initialized after calling [executeInitReserve](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ConfiguratorLogic.sol#L48), where it sends a requets to get a decimal value of a token:

```solidity
  function executeInitReserve(
    IPool pool,
    ConfiguratorInputTypes.InitReserveInput calldata input
  ) external {
    // It is an assumption that the asset listed is non-malicious, and the external call doesn't create re-entrancies
@>    uint8 underlyingAssetDecimals = IERC20Detailed(input.underlyingAsset).decimals();
    require(underlyingAssetDecimals > 5, Errors.INVALID_DECIMALS);
...
}
```

`Decimals` is an optional parameter to implement in a token contract, so it may be present in one chain and be absent in another. 
So in some cases the function will revert.

### Mitigation

Consider using a try/catch construction to check the call returns a value or revert.
