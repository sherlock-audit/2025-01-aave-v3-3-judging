# Malicious actors cause denial of service affecting protocol users

### Summary

External calls within loops in `getAllReservesTokens()` and `getAllATokens()` will cause denial of service for protocol users as attackers will manipulate the number of reserves to make these functions prohibitively expensive to call.


### Root Cause

In src/contracts/helpers/AaveProtocolDataProvider.sol#61-73 (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/helpers/AaveProtocolDataProvider.sol#L61-L73) the implementation makes external calls to `IERC20Detailed(aTokenAddress).symbol()` inside a loop without any limitation on the loop size


### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Protocol admin needs to approve and add number of reserves to be at least 50
2. User needs to call `getAllReservesTokens()` or `getAllATokens()` to trigger the expensive loops


### External Pre-conditions

1. Network gas price needs to be at least average to make the attack economically viable
2. ERC20 tokens `symbol()` functions must be accessible


### Attack Path

1. Attacker monitors the number of reserves in the protocol
2. Attacker waits until sufficient number of reserves are added to make loops expensive
3. When critical operations depend on these view functions, attacker spams network to increase gas prices
4. View functions become too expensive to call, disrupting protocol operations


### Impact

1. The protocol users cannot execute operations that depend on `getAllReservesTokens()` or `getAllATokens()`
2. The protocol suffers operational disruption and potential reputational damage
3. No direct financial loss but indirect costs from failed operations and high gas fees


### PoC

```solidity
function testDOSWithManyReserves() public {
    // Add many reserves to make loops expensive
    for(uint i = 0; i < 50; i++) {
        MockToken token = new MockToken(string(abi.encodePacked("TKN", i + 5)));
        MockToken aToken = new MockToken(string(abi.encodePacked("aTKN", i + 5)));
        pool.addReserve(address(token), address(aToken));
    }
    
    // Measure gas
    uint gasBefore = gasleft();
    dataProvider.getAllATokens();
    uint gasUsed = gasBefore - gasleft();
    
    console.log("Gas used:", gasUsed);
    assertTrue(gasUsed > 5000000, "Function should consume significant gas");
}
```

### Mitigation

1. Implement pagination for `getAllReservesTokens()` and `getAllATokens()`
2. Cache token symbols during reserve registration
3. Add circuit breakers for gas consumption
