# Incorrect handling of `liquidationProtocolFee` can lead to protocol fee miscalculation or loss.

### **Summary**  
The calculation of `liquidationProtocolFee` in `_calculateAvailableCollateralToLiquidate` incorrectly deducts the fee from the `collateralAmount` before returning, which may lead to a mismatch in the total collateral liquidated versus what is credited to the liquidator and the protocol.

---

### **Root Cause**  
In `LiquidationLogic.sol` (within [_calculateAvailableCollateralToLiquidate](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L671)), the `liquidationProtocolFee` is subtracted from the `collateralAmount` without ensuring proper separation of the liquidator's and protocol's shares. This can result in:
1. Liquidators receiving less collateral than expected.
2. The protocol's fee being double-counted or inaccurately applied.

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**  
1. A liquidation occurs where the `liquidationProtocolFeePercentage` is non-zero.
2. The calculated `liquidationProtocolFee` is deducted from the total `collateralAmount`.

---

### **External Pre-conditions**  
None (assumes trusted dependencies).

---

### **Attack Path**  
1. A liquidator calls the liquidation function.  
2. The `_calculateAvailableCollateralToLiquidate` function deducts the `liquidationProtocolFee` from `collateralAmount`.  
3. The returned `collateralAmount` excludes the protocol's fee, causing:
   - A mismatch in expected collateral transfer to the liquidator.
   - Potential double deduction of the protocol fee if the function consuming this logic also accounts for the fee separately.

---

### **Impact**  
The protocol may lose fees, or liquidators may receive less collateral than expected, reducing their incentive to participate in liquidation. This could destabilize the protocol's liquidation process and treasury balance.

---

### **Mitigation**  
Separate the `collateralAmount` and `liquidationProtocolFee` in the return values and ensure they are handled independently downstream.
