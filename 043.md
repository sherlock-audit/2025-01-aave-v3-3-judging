# Insufficient liquidity check in flash loan validation enables reserve depletion

### Summary:
The lack of an **available liquidity check** in `validateFlashloanSimple` (line where flash loan validation occurs) will cause **reserve depletion** for **the protocol** as **an attacker** will bypass liquidity constraints and execute a flash loan exceeding available liquidity.

---

### Root Cause:
In `ValidationLogic.validateFlashloanSimple` [line where `!configuration.getIsVirtualAccActive()` is checked](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L359-L363), the validation incorrectly relies on `totalSupply` instead of verifying `availableLiquidity`.

---

### Internal Pre-conditions:
1. A reserve needs to have a `getIsVirtualAccActive` flag set to `true`.
2. The reserve's total supply must be greater than or equal to the flash loan request, but the `availableLiquidity` is insufficient.

---

### External Pre-conditions:
1. The attacker has the ability to call the `flashLoan` function for the affected reserve.

---

### Attack Path:
1. The attacker calls the protocolâ€™s `flashLoan` function with an amount exceeding the reserve's `availableLiquidity`.
2. The protocol validates the request using `totalSupply` rather than `availableLiquidity`.
3. The protocol erroneously approves the flash loan, draining liquidity and destabilizing the reserve.

---

### Impact:
The **protocol** suffers potential insolvency, leaving users unable to withdraw or borrow from the reserve. 

---

### Mitigation:
Replace the `totalSupply` check in `validateFlashloanSimple` with a check against `availableLiquidity` to ensure the requested flash loan amount is backed by sufficient liquidity in the reserve.
