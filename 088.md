# Missing isolation mode exposure check in `validateBorrow` allows users to breach collateral debt ceilings in isolation mode

### **Summary**  
The **isolation mode exposure validation** in `validateBorrow` does not correctly ensure that the total debt exposure in isolation mode stays within the reserve's configured debt ceiling. This allows **users** to borrow beyond the allowed limits, breaking isolation mode guarantees and risking protocol insolvency.

---

### **Root Cause**  
In `ValidationLogic.sol`, the isolation mode validation [relies on the following check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L200-L207):

```solidity
      require(
        reservesData[params.isolationModeCollateralAddress].isolationModeTotalDebt +
          (params.amount /
            10 ** (vars.reserveDecimals - ReserveConfiguration.DEBT_CEILING_DECIMALS))
            .toUint128() <=
          params.isolationModeDebtCeiling,
        Errors.DEBT_CEILING_EXCEEDED
      );
```

This calculation assumes that the **new debt exposure** added by the borrow is correctly scaled, but it does not account for rounding errors or situations where `reserveDecimals` differ across assets, leading to potential breaches of the debt ceiling.

If `reserveDecimals = 18` and `DEBT_CEILING_DECIMALS = 6`, the scaling factor is `10^(18 - 6) = 10^12`.
Small amounts of debt (e.g., `10^11`) will scale down to `0`, allowing these amounts to bypass debt ceiling enforcement entirely.

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**  
1. A reserve is set to isolation mode with a specific debt ceiling.  
2. A user borrows an amount close to the ceiling, and rounding differences in the calculation bypass the ceiling enforcement.  

---

### **External Pre-conditions**  
1. Asset prices from the oracle must provide valid values.  
2. The reserve has varying decimal configurations compared to the collateral asset.  

---

### **Attack Path**  
1. A user borrows an amount that, when scaled using `reserveDecimals`, incorrectly bypasses the debt ceiling due to rounding differences.  
2. The protocol allows the borrow, resulting in a breach of the isolation mode's debt ceiling.  
3. The reserve accumulates excessive exposure, breaking isolation guarantees and exposing the protocol to potential insolvency.

---

### **Impact**  
The protocol's isolation mode becomes ineffective, increasing systemic risk and insolvency potential. Users relying on isolation mode safeguards may face cascading liquidations if reserves exceed their limits.  

---

### **Mitigation**  
Use a more precise scaling mechanism for debt ceiling enforcement to eliminate rounding risks.
