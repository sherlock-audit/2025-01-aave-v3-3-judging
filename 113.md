# The flawed validation logic in validateUseAsCollateral will cause a denial-of-service risk for isolation mode users

### Summary

The flawed validation logic in validateUseAsCollateral will cause a denial-of-service risk for isolation mode users as the protocol will prevent them from enabling their isolated asset as collateral, leading to unexpected liquidations.

### Root Cause

In ValidationLogic.sol, the validateUseAsCollateral function incorrectly blocks isolated assets from being enabled as collateral for users in isolation mode. Specifically, the line : [ValidationLogic.sol:608](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L608)
```solidity
return (!isolationModeActive && reserveConfig.getDebtCeiling() == 0);
```
fails to differentiate between the userâ€™s isolated asset and other assets, resulting in a blanket rejection of collateral activation.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1- User Configuration: The user must be in isolation mode for a specific asset (e.g., Asset X).
2- Collateral Activation Attempt: The user attempts to enable Asset X (their isolated asset) as collateral.

### External Pre-conditions

None. This is a protocol-level logic flaw

### Attack Path

1- User Enters Isolation Mode: The user borrows an isolated asset (e.g., GHO) and enters isolation mode.
2- User Attempts Collateral Activation: The user calls setUseReserveAsCollateral to enable their isolated asset as collateral.
3- Validation Fails: validateUseAsCollateral returns false due to the flawed logic, blocking the action.

### Impact

Affected Party : Users in isolation mode.

Loss : Users cannot use their isolated asset as collateral, leading to:
- Inability to improve their health factor
- Increased risk of liquidation due to undercollateralization

### PoC

1- User Enters Isolation Mode:
Borrows an isolated asset (e.g., GHO) and enters isolation mode.

2- Attempt to Enable Collateral:
Calls setUseReserveAsCollateral to enable the isolated asset (GHO) as collateral.

3- Validation Fails:
validateUseAsCollateral returns false because isolationModeActive = true, blocking the action.

The [executeBorrow](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L60) function does not auto-enable the isolated asset as collateral, and the validateUseAsCollateral logic incorrectly blocks manual activation

### Mitigation

Modify validateUseAsCollateral to explicitly allow isolated assets when the user is in isolation mode :
```solidity
  function validateUseAsCollateral(...) internal view returns (bool) {
      if (reserveConfig.getLtv() == 0) return false;
      if (!userConfig.isUsingAsCollateralAny()) return true;
      (bool isolationModeActive, , ) = userConfig.getIsolationModeState(...);
-     return (!isolationModeActive && reserveConfig.getDebtCeiling() == 0);
+     if (userConfig.isIsolated()) {
+         return (asset == userConfig.getIsolatedAsset());
+     }
+     return (reserveConfig.getDebtCeiling() == 0);
  }
```
This ensures users in isolation mode can enable their isolated asset while blocking others
