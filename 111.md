# Liquidators may not have sufficient incentive to liquidate positions

### Summary

Liquidators may not have sufficient incentive to liquidate users for some unbalanced positions if there is insufficient bonus collateral to cover the debt.

### Root Cause

A liquidation is a special system for a lending protocol to give its users enough incentive to liquidate bad positions by offering them some bonus tokens.  Othervise users will refuse to cover protocol debt.

When a liquidation happens a user offer some of his tokens to cover the debt in exchange of a user collateral plus bonus tokens. 

After the first liquidation, the positions might be imbalanced: more debt tokens and less collateral tokens. And with every liquidation transaction the difference between collateral/debt tokens increase. 

The protocol has a specail system to prevent any dust tokens by implementing [MIN_LEFTOVER_BASE](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L83). This means that if the amount of collateral/debt tokens is less than this, a liquidator should close 100% of the position. 

There may be a situation where both collateral and debt tokens are slightly above MIN_LEFTOVER_BASE, but there is not enough bonus collateral for the user to have an incentive to liquidate the position. 

In this way debt will remain on the protocol as no users will want to liquidate it.

### Impact

Positions will not be liquidated and a bad debt remains on the protocol.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

It's hard to offer the best choice for this question, and I can only think of the next one. Consider an additional check for a remaining debt amount to have enough bonus tokens to close the position. The position should be liquidated for 100% if there is no bonus collateral left after the liquidation.
