# Protocol will experience fund loss due to unchecked transfer returns

### Summary

Unchecked return value from `aWETH.transferFrom()` can cause fund loss for the protocol as failed transfers won't revert, leading to inconsistent state and potential silent failures.



### Root Cause

In src/contracts/helpers/WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol#64 (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/helpers/WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol#L64) the `transferFrom` return value is not checked:

```solidity
aWETH.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountToWithdraw);
```




### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User needs to call `withdrawETH` with valid amount
2. `aWETH.transferFrom` needs to return false without reverting


### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User calls `withdrawETH()` with some amount
2. The `aWETH.transferFrom()` silently fails
3. Function continues execution despite failed transfer
4. Contract state becomes inconsistent

### Impact

1. Protocol may lose funds due to unchecked transfer returns
2. Users may experience failed withdrawals without proper error handling

### PoC

```solidity
contract MaliciousToken {
    function transferFrom(address from, address to, uint256 amount) external returns (bool) {
        return false; // Silent failure
    }
}

contract TransferReturnPoC {
    WrappedTokenGatewayV3 gateway;
    
    function testUncheckedTransfer() public {
        MaliciousToken token = new MaliciousToken();
        uint256 amount = 1 ether;
        
        // Transfer fails silently
        gateway.withdrawETH(address(token), amount, address(this));
        // Transaction completes despite failed transfer
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Add return value check

```solidity
bool success = aWETH.transferFrom(msg.sender, address(this), amountToWithdraw);
require(success, "Token transfer failed");
```
