# Miscalculated Collateral Sufficiency Allows Over-Borrowing in Isolation Mode

### **Summary**  
A missing adjustment for **effective collateral** in isolation mode will cause **over-borrowing** for **borrowers** as the protocol will **overestimate available collateral**, allowing borrowers to take loans exceeding safe thresholds.  

---

### **Root Cause**   
In `ValidationLogic.validateBorrow`, the function calculates [vars.userCollateralInBaseCurrency](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L256-L257) using all user collateral without filtering for eligibility based on **liquidation thresholds** or **isolation mode constraints**. This causes the protocol to overestimate the amount of collateral available to secure a loan, allowing borrowers to exceed safe borrowing limits in isolation mode. The missing logic fails to exclude assets that either:  
1. Have a **zero liquidation threshold** (non-liquidatable collateral).  
2. Are restricted by **isolation mode debt ceilings**.

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**  
1. **Protocol Admin** needs to configure an asset with `isolationModeActive = true` and a non-zero `debtCeiling`.  
2. **User** needs to supply assets with **non-zero liquidation thresholds** in isolation mode.  

---

### **External Pre-conditions**  
1. **Collateral Prices** from the oracle must remain stable or increase slightly to avoid immediate liquidation.  

---

### **Attack Path**  
1. **User** supplies collateral in isolation mode with a high LTV but a non-zero liquidation threshold.  
2. **User** attempts to borrow assets using `borrow()`.  
3. The system incorrectly calculates the userâ€™s total collateral, including **ineligible collateral**, and approves the borrow.  
4. **User** withdraws borrowed funds, leaving the protocol under-collateralized.  

---

### **Impact**  
- The **protocol** suffers a potential loss of **bad debt**, as under-collateralized positions cannot be fully liquidated.  
- The **borrower** gains excess borrowing power, effectively draining the reserve.  

---

### **Mitigation**  
Adjust the calculation in `validateBorrow` to consider only **liquidation-threshold-adjusted collateral**:
