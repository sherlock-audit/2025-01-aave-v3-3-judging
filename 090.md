# deficit storage position could break core invariant

### Summary

[`_reserves`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/pool/PoolStorage.sol#L21) is an internal storage variable that maps reserves to their  `DataTypes.ReserveData`. in [`ReserveData`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/types/DataTypes.sol#L42-L78) struct, deficit took a storage position, 
that in a previous version (piror to 3.2)  was occupied by `currentStableBorrowRate` , which was deprecated on version 3.2 : 

```solidity
// OLD VERSION

 struct ReserveData {
    //stores the reserve configuration
    ReserveConfigurationMap configuration;
    //the liquidity index. Expressed in ray
    uint128 liquidityIndex;
    //the current supply rate. Expressed in ray
    uint128 currentLiquidityRate;
    //variable borrow index. Expressed in ray
    uint128 variableBorrowIndex;
    //the current variable borrow rate. Expressed in ray
   uint128 currentVariableBorrowRate;
    //the current stable borrow rate. Expressed in ray
>   uint128 currentStableBorrowRate;
    //timestamp of last update
    uint40 lastUpdateTimestamp;
    //the id of the reserve. Represents the position in the list of the active reserves 
    uint16 id;

//...

 }
```
```solidity
// v3.3

struct ReserveData {
    //stores the reserve configuration
    ReserveConfigurationMap configuration;
    //the liquidity index. Expressed in ray
    uint128 liquidityIndex;
    //the current supply rate. Expressed in ray
    uint128 currentLiquidityRate;
    //variable borrow index. Expressed in ray
    uint128 variableBorrowIndex;
    //the current variable borrow rate. Expressed in ray
    uint128 currentVariableBorrowRate;
    /// @notice reused `__deprecatedStableBorrowRate` storage from pre 3.2
    // the current accumulate deficit in underlying tokens
>   uint128 deficit;
    //timestamp of last update
    uint40 lastUpdateTimestamp;
    //the id of the reserve. Represents the position in the list of the active reserves
    uint16 id;

//...

}
```
This approach is actually a good one, to avoid corrupting the state of storage data. `currentStableBorrowRate` was uint128 (16 bytes) and `deficit` is uint128 (16 bytes), so it fits perfectly.

But the problem is that `currentStableBorrowRate` could still hold data, and there is no method or logic to clear it's storage which will break the invariant : [**The deficit of all reserves should initially be zero, even if bad debt was created before the protocol upgrade.**](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/docs/3.3/Aave-v3.3-properties.md?plain=1#L9).


### Root Cause

The upgrade reuses the storage slot of `currentStableBorrowRate` as `deficit` without clearing old data. 


### Impact

Invariant Violation


### Mitigation

Clear Data on Upgrade: Reset deficit for all reserves during the migration.
