# Incorrect handling of `lastUpdateTimestamp` can lead to skipped state updates.

### Summary:
If `reserve.lastUpdateTimestamp` matches `block.timestamp`, **state updates are skipped** for **reserve data**, as the system assumes no meaningful time has elapsed, causing **loss of accrued interest** or **inconsistent reserve state**.

---

### Root Cause:
[The check](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ReserveLogic.sol#L98-L100) `if (reserveCache.reserveLastUpdateTimestamp == uint40(block.timestamp)) { return; }` prevents updates to indexes and treasury accruals when the timestamp matches, even when meaningful actions (e.g., liquidity changes) occur in the same block.

---

### Internal Pre-conditions:
1. `reserve.lastUpdateTimestamp` is set to the current block's `timestamp`.
2. A function triggering `updateState` is called again within the same block (e.g., consecutive liquidity updates or flash loan repayments).

---

### External Pre-conditions:
1. A user or contract interaction (e.g., deposit, borrow, or repay) triggers reserve updates multiple times within a single block.

---

### Attack Path:
1. A user calls a function that triggers `updateState`, setting `lastUpdateTimestamp` to `block.timestamp`.
2. Another function (e.g., a repay or flash loan) is called within the same block.
3. The state update logic is skipped due to the timestamp match, resulting in missed updates to indexes and treasury accruals.

---

### Impact:
- The **protocol treasury** loses accrued fees or interest for actions performed in the same block.
- **Users and the protocol** face inconsistent reserve states, as changes are not reflected correctly.

---

### Mitigation:
Replace the strict timestamp equality check with a condition that allows updates for meaningful reserve changes:
```solidity
if (reserveCache.reserveLastUpdateTimestamp == uint40(block.timestamp) && liquidityAdded == 0 && liquidityTaken == 0) {
    return;
}
```
