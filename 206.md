# Active collaterals with zero LTV will prevent deficit formation

### Summary

GenericLogic's `calculateUserAccountData()` accounts for zero LTV collateral value in its `totalCollateralInBaseCurrency` output, but this collateral doesn't back anything even if the reserve is active for a borrower. It will prevent deficit formation for them despite there is no chance of restoring HF until collateral configuration changes.

In other words, zero LTV collaterals don't act as collaterals in term of backing any debt, they are separate deposits instead, but still block deficit formation in the current logic.

### Root Cause

If a collateral have non zero LT, zero LTV (e.g. LUSD), and is enabled for the borrower, it will be accounted for in `calculateUserAccountData()`:

[GenericLogic.sol#L109-L117](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/GenericLogic.sol#L109-L117)

```solidity
      if (vars.liquidationThreshold != 0 && params.userConfig.isUsingAsCollateral(vars.i)) {
        vars.userBalanceInBaseCurrency = _getUserBalanceInBaseCurrency(
          params.user,
          currentReserve,
          vars.assetPrice,
          vars.assetUnit
        );

        vars.totalCollateralInBaseCurrency += vars.userBalanceInBaseCurrency;
```

So `totalCollateralInBaseCurrency = nonZeroLTVCollateral + zeroLTVCollateral` will be higher than value of the collateral actually utilized for collateralization:

[LiquidationLogic.sol#L215-L233](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L215-L233)

```solidity
    (
      vars.totalCollateralInBaseCurrency,
      vars.totalDebtInBaseCurrency,
      ,
      ,
      vars.healthFactor,

    ) = GenericLogic.calculateUserAccountData(
      reservesData,
      reservesList,
      eModeCategories,
      DataTypes.CalculateUserAccountDataParams({
        userConfig: userConfig,
        reservesCount: params.reservesCount,
        user: params.user,
        oracle: params.priceOracle,
        userEModeCategory: params.userEModeCategory
      })
    );
```

So, it will be `totalCollateralInBaseCurrency > collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency` and `hasNoCollateralLeft == false`, but debt recovery wouldn't be possible whenever market is until protocol parameters change:

[LiquidationLogic.sol#L357-L358](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L357-L358)

```solidity
    bool hasNoCollateralLeft = vars.totalCollateralInBaseCurrency ==
      vars.collateralToLiquidateInBaseCurrency;
```

### Internal Pre-conditions

There is a zero LTV enabled collateral for the borrower, i.e. `params.userConfig.isUsingAsCollateral(vars.i) == true`. Other collateral the borrower have doesn't support their debt and deficit conditions are met.

### External Pre-conditions

There are some market drop, so the deficit conditions are formed.

### Attack Path

E.g. enabling assets as collaterals when it's known that their LTV be set to zero forms a griefing surface in this case.

### Impact

The same as in other issues resulting in deficit failing to be formed:

> Since allowing the 50% of all the total debt to be liquidated at once is a extra payoff for liquidators at the expense of the borrowers in order to provide bad debt clearing and deficit formation, the failure to do so is a direct loss for the borrowers from the 3.3 release. I.e. in the described circumstances nothing changes bad debt vice, it's still unrealized and require manual DAO intervention (repaying on behalf), but borrowers now lose more LB to liquidators.


### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Consider ignoring such assets in `calculateUserAccountData()` for liquidations sake.
