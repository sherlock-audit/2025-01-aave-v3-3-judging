# Inconsistent Native Token Symbol Representation in Protocol Data Provider

### Summary

The `AaveProtocolDataProvider` contract contains hardcoding of 'ETH' as the symbol for native tokens across all networks:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/helpers/AaveProtocolDataProvider.sol#L39

```solidity
if (reserves[i] == ETH) {
    reservesTokens[i] = TokenData({symbol: 'ETH', tokenAddress: reserves[i]});
    continue;
}
```

While the special address `0xEeeeeEeeeEeEeeEeEeEeeEEEeeeeEeeeeeeeEEeE` is correctly used as a protocol-wide standard to represent native tokens across different networks, the hardcoding of 'ETH' as the symbol creates inconsistencies when the protocol is deployed on non-Ethereum networks.

The impact is significant for user experience and protocol integrations:

- On Polygon, the native token MATIC would be incorrectly represented as 'ETH'
- On Avalanche, AVAX would be labeled as 'ETH'
- On other L2s and sidechains, their respective native tokens would all show as 'ETH'

This can lead to:
- Confusion for users interacting with the protocol across different networks
- Potential integration issues for protocols that rely on accurate token symbols
- Inconsistent data representation in protocol UIs and tools

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1. Implement a network-aware symbol mapping for native tokens:

```solidity
mapping(uint256 => string) private nativeTokenSymbols;

function setNativeTokenSymbol(uint256 chainId, string memory symbol) external onlyAdmin {
    nativeTokenSymbols[chainId] = symbol;
    emit NativeTokenSymbolUpdated(chainId, symbol);
}

function getNativeTokenSymbol() public view returns (string memory) {
    string memory symbol = nativeTokenSymbols[block.chainid];
    return bytes(symbol).length > 0 ? symbol : "ETH"; // Fallback to ETH if not set
}
```

2. Modify the `getAllReservesTokens()` function to use this mapping:

```solidity
if (reserves[i] == ETH) {
    reservesTokens[i] = TokenData({
        symbol: getNativeTokenSymbol(),
        tokenAddress: reserves[i]
    });
    continue;
}
```

3. Initialize appropriate symbols during protocol deployment on each network:
- Ethereum: "ETH"
- Polygon: "MATIC"
- Avalanche: "AVAX"
- etc.

This solution:
- Maintains correct native token identification across networks
- Provides accurate symbol representation for each chain
- Preserves protocol's cross-chain compatibility
- Improves user experience and integration reliability
