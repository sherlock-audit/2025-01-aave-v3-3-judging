# Gas Cost Explosion in Bad Debt Cleanup

### Summary

The `_burnBadDebt` function within the liquidation logic iterates through all active reserves when attempting to clean up bad debt. This process introduces a linear increase in gas costs proportional to the number of reserves. In situations where the number of active reserves is large which will be common case in (e.g., Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, etc.) where the protocol can support a large number of reserves, or when the protocol is deployed on high-traffic chains, this function risks exceeding the block gas limit, potentially rendering it unusable.

### Root Cause

```solidity
for (uint256 i; i < reservesCount; i++) {
    if (!userConfig.isBorrowing(i)) {
        continue;
    }
    ...
    _burnDebtTokens(...);
}

```

This loop scales with the number of reserves (reservesCount), iterating through all reserves regardless of whether bad debt exists.

### Attack Path

The issue manifests in scenarios with:

1- High Reserve Count: Aave v3.3's design allows deployment across multiple chains **(e.g., Ethereum, Arbitrum, Optimism, Polygon, etc.)** where the protocol can support a large number of reserves. For example, if the protocol manages **100+** reserves, the loop will execute **100+ iterations**, **even when many reserves do not have outstanding bad debt**.

2-Complex User Configurations: Users may have debt positions across multiple reserves, exacerbating the computational workload for the `_burnBadDebt` function.

3-Gas Constraints: During periods of high network activity **(e.g., on Ethereum mainnet)**, gas prices rise significantly. The iterative nature of `_burnBadDebt` can lead to failed transactions due to block gas limit restrictions.

- Assume reservesCount = 100 and that 20 reserves contain bad debt. The loop processes all 100 reserves to identify and handle the bad debt, consuming unnecessary gas for reserves without debt.
- With high gas fees or complex reserve states, this process risks hitting the block gas limit, especially on gas-constrained chains like **Ethereum or BNB Chain.**


### Impact

1- **Liquidation Failures**
Users with debt positions spanning multiple reserves may be unable to liquidate their positions due to the high gas cost of the` _burnBadDebt` function.
This could result in cascading insolvency across the protocol if bad debt accumulates and cannot be efficiently cleared.

2. **Denial of Service**
Liquidators may avoid liquidating positions due to prohibitive gas costs, leading to a backlog of unaddressed bad debt. Over time, this can destabilize the protocol.

3. **Cross-Chain Vulnerability**
Chains like **Ethereum or Polygon**, which experience congestion and high gas prices, are more susceptible to this issue. On these chains, even moderate reserve counts could render the function unusable.

### PoC

### Mitigation

**1- Optimized Iteration**
Implement a mapping or index that tracks only reserves with active debt. This reduces the number of iterations in the _burnBadDebt loop:
`mapping(address => bool) activeDebtReserves;`
Only iterate through reserves with known bad debt, avoiding unnecessary computations.

**2. Batched Processing**
Allow` _burnBadDebt `to process reserves in smaller batches across multiple transactions to avoid exceeding gas limits:
```solidity
function _burnBadDebtBatch(uint256 start, uint256 end) external {
    for (uint256 i = start; i < end && i < reservesCount; i++) {
        if (!userConfig.isBorrowing(i)) continue;
        ...
    }
}
```
