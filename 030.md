# Improper Fee Calculation in `executeBackUnbacked` May Lead to Loss of Treasury Fees

### **Summary**  
A miscalculation in the fee allocation logic in `executeBackUnbacked` will cause **incorrect fee distribution** for the **protocol treasury** as **rounding errors in `fee.percentMul(protocolFeeBps)`** can lead to a portion of the fee being lost.

---

### **Root Cause**  
In BridgeLogic.sol, the fee is split into [protocol fees and liquidity provider (LP) fees](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BridgeLogic.sol#L134-L135) using percentage math:  
```solidity
uint256 feeToProtocol = fee.percentMul(protocolFeeBps); // Calculates protocol's share of the fee
uint256 feeToLP = fee - feeToProtocol; // Remainder allocated to LPs
```
However, **`percentMul` truncates results due to integer division**, leading to rounding errors. This causes the `feeToProtocol + feeToLP` to be slightly less than the total `fee`, resulting in a small portion of the fee being lost. `percentMul`**, defined in Aave’s math libraries, performs multiplication followed by integer division (`(a * b) / 10_000`), which inherently truncates fractional results. This truncation ensures the sum of `feeToProtocol` and `feeToLP` is slightly less than `fee` due to the discarded remainder. 

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**  
1. The `protocolFeeBps` is set to a valid value (e.g., 10_000 BPS = 100%).  
2. `executeBackUnbacked` is called with a non-zero `fee`.

---

### **External Pre-conditions**  
1. The caller interacts with the contract, triggering `executeBackUnbacked`.  
2. Dependencies (e.g., `percentMul`) are assumed to be functional but subject to truncation.

---

### **Attack Path**  
1. A user backs unbacked tokens via `executeBackUnbacked` with a specified `fee`.  
2. The protocol calculates `feeToProtocol` and `feeToLP`.  
3. Due to rounding in `percentMul`, the total of these values is slightly less than the original `fee`.  
4. The difference is effectively "lost" as it’s not allocated to the protocol or LPs.

---

### **Impact**  
The **protocol treasury** and **LPs** collectively lose a small fraction of the fees due to rounding errors, leading to potential financial inefficiency over many transactions. While each transaction's impact is minimal, the cumulative effect could result in significant losses.

---

### **Mitigation**  
Adjust the calculation to ensure no fees are lost by assigning the rounding error to the LPs or the protocol. 

```solidity
uint256 feeToProtocol = fee.percentMul(protocolFeeBps);
uint256 feeToLP = fee - feeToProtocol; // Handles remainder implicitly
assert(feeToProtocol + feeToLP == fee); // Ensures all fees are accounted for
```
