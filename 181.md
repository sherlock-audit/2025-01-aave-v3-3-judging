# When deficit is repaid the liquidity index is not updated correctly

### Summary

When there is a deficit, the debt tokens are burnt and the deficit is increased. Deficit increase is accounted in liquidity rate as unbacked tokens which unbacked tokens decrease the supply rate. When the unbacked tokens are repaid, the liquidity index is increased so that the aToken holders can claim the returned tokens. However, when deficit is repaid the liquidity index is not updated like unbacked tokens leading that the debt repaid is idle in contract. 

### Root Cause


When there are unbacked tokens (deficit and unbacked), the liquidity rate is calculated as follows:  
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/misc/DefaultReserveInterestRateStrategyV2.sol#L141-L176  

We can observe here in these lines that the supplyRate is multiplied by the supplyUsageRatio, which is calculated as debt / available liquidity + unbacked tokens:  
```solidity
vars.currentLiquidityRate = vars
      .currentVariableBorrowRate
      .rayMul(vars.supplyUsageRatio)
      .percentMul(PercentageMath.PERCENTAGE_FACTOR - params.reserveFactor);
```

This basically means that when debt occurs, the interest is distributed to a lesser extent, considering that unbacked tokens' aToken holders are nonexistent until they are backed.

And here we can observe that when the unbacked tokens are backed, the underlying tokens are sent to the aToken, interest rates are updated, and most importantly, the `liquidityIndex` is updated such that the aToken holders now socialize the profits from it:  
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BridgeLogic.sol#L138-L149  

Now, when we check how the deficit is repaid (treated as unbacked in rate calculation), the liquidity index is not increased, but only the rate and the token transfers occur! This means that the repaid deficit didn't reflect on the aToken holders. When they withdraw, they will not see the effects of the repaid deficit!

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Deficit is repaid 

### External Pre-conditions

None needed

### Attack Path

No attack path, can happen naturally whenever deficit is repaid.

### Impact

Repaid deficit will not reflect to aToken holders. aToken will have idle tokens in its balance, repaid funds will be lost since they will not be used for repayment. 

### PoC

```solidity
function test_eliminateDeficit_misaccountingIndex(
  ) public {
    address coverageAdmin = address(0x69);
    uint120 borrowAmount = 100_000e18;
    _filterAddresses(coverageAdmin);
    uint256 currentDeficit = _createReserveDeficit(borrowAmount, tokenList.usdx);

    vm.prank(poolAdmin);
    contracts.poolAddressesProvider.setAddress(bytes32('UMBRELLA'), coverageAdmin);

    DataTypes.ReserveDataLegacy memory reserveData = contracts.poolProxy.getReserveData(
      tokenList.usdx
    );

    // +1 to account for imprecision on supply
    _mintATokens(tokenList.usdx, coverageAdmin, currentDeficit + 1);

    vm.startPrank(coverageAdmin);
    IERC20(tokenList.usdx).approve(report.poolProxy, UINT256_MAX);
    DataTypes.UserConfigurationMap memory userConfigBefore = contracts
      .poolProxy
      .getUserConfiguration(coverageAdmin);
    assertEq(userConfigBefore.isUsingAsCollateral(reserveData.id), true);

    // eliminate deficit
    vm.expectEmit(address(contracts.poolProxy));
    emit DeficitCovered(tokenList.usdx, coverageAdmin, currentDeficit);
    uint256 normalizedIncomeBefore = contracts.poolProxy.getReserveNormalizedIncome(tokenList.usdx);
    console.log("normalizedIncome before", normalizedIncomeBefore);
    contracts.poolProxy.eliminateReserveDeficit(tokenList.usdx, currentDeficit);

    assertEq(contracts.poolProxy.getReserveDeficit(tokenList.usdx), 0);

    uint256 normalizedIncomeAfter = contracts.poolProxy.getReserveNormalizedIncome(tokenList.usdx);
    console.log("normalizedIncome after", normalizedIncomeAfter);

    // problem!!
    assertEq(normalizedIncomeAfter, normalizedIncomeBefore);
  }
```

### Mitigation

Increase the liquidity index just like it's done in unbacked tokens backing.
