# Debt Ceiling Logic

#Description

#Summary 

In the https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L60 function, the 
https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L110 calculations does not check if the resulting value exceeds the https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L75

#Vulnerability details

The function executeBorrow has a Debt Ceiling Logic vulnerability in the calculation of nextIsolationModeTotalDebt. Specifically, it does not validate whether the nextIsolationModeTotalDebt exceeds the isolationModeDebtCeiling. The calculation increases the isolationModeTotalDebt based on the borrow amount but does not ensure that the updated isolationModeTotalDebt remains within the isolationModeDebtCeiling.

#Impact 

If isolationModeTotalDebt exceeds isolationModeDebtCeiling:

Bypassing Isolation Mode Constraints: The debt ceiling is a critical safeguard in isolation mode, designed to limit the total borrowable debt backed by a specific type of collateral. Exceeding this ceiling undermines the risk mitigation intended by isolation mode.

Overexposure: The protocol could become overexposed to volatile or illiquid collateral. If the value of the isolated collateral drops, it may not sufficiently cover the outstanding debt, leading to losses for the protocol or its users.

Systemic Risk: Overexposure to risky assets or illiquid markets can lead to cascading liquidations or insolvencies, potentially destabilizing the protocol.

#Mitigation

Add Validation to Prevent Ceiling Exceedance: Introduce a check to ensure that the nextIsolationModeTotalDebt does not exceed the isolationModeDebtCeiling before updating the value:

uint256 newDebt = (params.amount /
    10 **
    (reserveCache.reserveConfiguration.getDecimals() - 
    ReserveConfiguration.DEBT_CEILING_DECIMALS)).toUint128();

require(
    reservesData[isolationModeCollateralAddress].isolationModeTotalDebt + newDebt <= isolationModeDebtCeiling,
    "Debt ceiling exceeded"
);

reservesData[isolationModeCollateralAddress].isolationModeTotalDebt += newDebt;
