# Liquidators can still purposefully leave dust positions which are unprofitable to be closed.

### Summary
With the new V3.3 update, AAVE introduces new logic which should prevent leaving low-value liquidateable positions as it is unprofitable for liquidators (for example on mainnet due to gas fees) and they keep on accruing fees.

This should be achieved by requiring at least one of the following 3 is true when liquidating:
- all debt is liquidated
- all collateral is liquidated
- there's at least $1,000 in debt and at least $1,000 in collateral

```solidity
    if (
      vars.actualDebtToLiquidate < vars.userReserveDebt &&
      vars.actualCollateralToLiquidate + vars.liquidationProtocolFeeAmount <
      vars.userCollateralBalance
    ) {
      bool isDebtMoreThanLeftoverThreshold = ((vars.userReserveDebt - vars.actualDebtToLiquidate) *
        vars.debtAssetPrice) /
        vars.debtAssetUnit >=
        MIN_LEFTOVER_BASE;

      bool isCollateralMoreThanLeftoverThreshold = ((vars.userCollateralBalance -
        vars.actualCollateralToLiquidate -
        vars.liquidationProtocolFeeAmount) * vars.collateralAssetPrice) /
        vars.collateralAssetUnit >=
        MIN_LEFTOVER_BASE;

      require(
        isDebtMoreThanLeftoverThreshold && isCollateralMoreThanLeftoverThreshold,
        Errors.MUST_NOT_LEAVE_DUST
      );
    }
```

The problem is that this is insufficient and still allows liquidator to purposefully leave out small position which only damage the protocol.

To provide an example: 
1. User has $5,000 debt in USDC and $1,500 debt in USDT
2. User has $5,100 collateral in WBTC and $1,600 collateral in WETH.
3. Liquidator liquidates $3,000 USDC debt for $3,030 WBTC collateral.
4. Liquidator liquidates $1,550 USDC for $1,600 WETH collateral
5. Liquidator liquidates $1,500 USDT for $1,550 in WBTC.
6. In the end, the remaining assets are $450 USDC debt and $520 WBTC. Both of them are below the $1,000 which otherwise should've been enforced. Due to gas costs it is unprofitable for any liquidator to liquidate them. They're only accruing interest and damaging the protocol.


### Root Cause
Faulty logic

### Internal Pre-conditions
User should have multiple assets as collateral

### Impact
Intended logic is not properly enforced. Low value liquidateable loans can still exist. They will accrue interest over time and only damage the protocol.

### Mitigation
Fix is non-trivial.
