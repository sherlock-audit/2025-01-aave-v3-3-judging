# Deficit accounting can be prevented by supplying 1 wei of a different collateral

### Summary

Deficit accounting can be prevented by supplying 1 wei of a different collateral

### Root Cause

Deficit accounting only occurs when `hasNoCollateralLeft` is true, but the liquidation only takes the collateral of one reserve. There is no incentive to carry out the 2nd liquidation on the 1 wei of other collateral.

### Internal Pre-conditions

A position reaches a state of bad debt

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path
1. Position reaches state of bad debt
2. Before the bad debt liquidation, the borrower supplies 1 wei of a different collateral to what is being liquidated
3. Liquidation occurs, deficit accounting does not occur since `hasNoCollateralLeft` is false
4. It is not economical to liquidate the dust of 1 wei, so the bad debt will remain, and the deficit will not be accounted, so `executeEliminateDeficit()` will not account for this bad debt

### Impact
Deficit accounting is prevented, and the outstanding debt remains.

### Mitigation
