# Protocol fee misalignment in collateral liquidation causes treasury losses.

### **Summary**  
The `liquidationProtocolFee` is deducted from the **bonus collateral** instead of the total collateral, which results in misaligned fee calculations, leading to lower-than-expected protocol fees for the treasury.

---

### **Root Cause**  
In `LiquidationLogic.sol` (within `_calculateAvailableCollateralToLiquidate`), the `liquidationProtocolFee` is calculated using only the [bonus collateral](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L664-L666) (`collateralAmount - collateralAmount.percentDiv(liquidationBonus)`) instead of the **total collateral amount** being liquidated. This creates an unintended reduction in fees collected by the protocol.

The **`liquidationProtocolFee`** is calculated only on the **bonus collateral** instead of the **total collateral amount being liquidated**. The bonus collateral is computed as:  
```solidity
 vars.bonusCollateral =
        vars.collateralAmount -
        vars.collateralAmount.percentDiv(liquidationBonus);
```

Then, the fee is applied [only to this bonus](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L668-L670) portion:  
```solidity
 vars.liquidationProtocolFee = vars.bonusCollateral.percentMul(
        vars.liquidationProtocolFeePercentage
      );
```

This approach ignores the base collateral portion (`collateralAmount - bonusCollateral`), meaning the protocol collects fees on a smaller value than the actual collateral liquidated.

**Correct Behavior**: The protocol fee should be calculated on the **entire `collateralAmount`**, not just the bonus, to align with the expected fee structure.

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**  
1. The `liquidationBonus` is greater than `0`, leading to a bonus collateral calculation.  
2. The `liquidationProtocolFeePercentage` is set to a non-zero value in the reserve configuration.  
3. The protocol fee calculation is applied only to the bonus collateral.

---

### **External Pre-conditions**  
None (assumes trusted dependencies and valid oracle prices).

---

### **Attack Path**  
1. A liquidator initiates a liquidation for a user holding collateral.  
2. The `_calculateAvailableCollateralToLiquidate` function applies the `liquidationProtocolFee` only on the **bonus collateral**.  
3. The protocol collects less in fees than it should, as the fee is not calculated on the total collateral amount.

---

### **Impact**  
The protocol treasury collects lower fees than expected for liquidations, leading to significant losses over time as the fee structure is misaligned with the total collateral liquidated.

---

### **Mitigation**  
The `liquidationProtocolFee` should be calculated on the **total collateral amount** instead of just the bonus collateral. Update the fee calculation in `_calculateAvailableCollateralToLiquidate`.
