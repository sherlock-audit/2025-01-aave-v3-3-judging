# `repayETH` can result in loss of excess ETH during repayment.

### Summary

The failure to refund the entire excess ETH when `msg.value > paybackAmount` will cause ETH loss for users as the contract may retain unclaimed dust ETH if the exact refund logic is not implemented correctly.

### Root Cause

In [WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/helpers/WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol#L75-L94), the contract refunds excess ETH after depositing `paybackAmount` to `WETH`, but does not account for edge cases where dust ETH (remaining small fractions) might remain in the contract due to rounding issues.
 
   Contracts interacting with `msg.value` often deal with rounding issues or leftover ETH. This is particularly true when interacting with contracts like `WETH` or `POOL`, which may have rounding discrepancies or fixed-point arithmetic constraints.
   In [repayETH](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/helpers/WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol#L93):
   ```solidity
   if (msg.value > paybackAmount) _safeTransferETH(msg.sender, msg.value - paybackAmount);
   ```
   The contract **only refunds the explicit difference** between `msg.value` and `paybackAmount`. However, **dust ETH** can remain in the contract due to:
   - Rounding discrepancies in `WETH.deposit`.
   - Small mismatches when converting ETH to WETH or handling fractional amounts.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User calls `repayETH` with `msg.value` greater than the debt being repaid (`paybackAmount`).


### External Pre-conditions

1. Rounding discrepancies arise in WETH’s `deposit` function or the pool’s internal handling of debt.


### Attack Path

1. User sends `msg.value` slightly greater than the actual repayment amount (e.g., to ensure full coverage).
2. Contract performs repayment but refunds only the computed difference (`msg.value - paybackAmount`).
3. Dust ETH remains in the contract, which the user cannot retrieve, resulting in ETH loss over multiple transactions.

### Impact

The user suffers a loss of residual ETH (dust ETH) left in the contract after repayment. Over time, this could accumulate significantly for high-traffic contracts.



### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Ensure all residual ETH is refunded to the user after the repayment is completed. Modify `repayETH` as follows:
```solidity
if (address(this).balance > 0) {
  _safeTransferETH(msg.sender, address(this).balance);
}
```
