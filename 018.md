# Incorrect handling of `useATokens` during repayment leads to loss of collateral.

### **Summary:**  
The failure to validate `useATokens` repayment mode when a user has insufficient `aTokens` balance will cause a partial repayment or unintended debt clearing for the user as the `burn` function fails or creates collateral inconsistencies.

---

### **Root Cause:**  
In [BorrowLogic.sol](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L188), when `params.useATokens` is true, the repayment amount (`params.amount`) defaults to the caller’s `aTokens` balance, but there is no validation to ensure the balance is sufficient for the desired repayment.

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions:**  
1. User has an active debt position and collateral provided in `aTokens`.
2. User calls `executeRepay` with `useATokens = true`, but their `aTokens` balance is less than `params.amount`.

---

### **External Pre-conditions:**  
1. No manipulation of external reserves or dependencies is required.
2. Users are actively using `aTokens` as collateral.

---

### **Attack Path:**  
1. A user has an active borrow position and partially redeemed their `aTokens` (e.g., borrowed 100 units but holds only 50 `aTokens`).
2. The user calls `executeRepay` with `useATokens = true` and sets `params.amount` to a value exceeding their available `aTokens` balance (e.g., 100 units).  
3. The repayment process attempts to burn `aTokens` (via `IAToken.burn`), leading to incomplete repayment or a revert.  
4. If incomplete repayment occurs, the user’s remaining collateral is mismanaged, leaving the system with improper debt and collateral accounting.

---

### **Impact:**  
Users may lose their remaining collateral (`aTokens`) without fully repaying their debt, or the protocol may encounter collateral-debt inconsistencies. This creates systemic risks and potential user losses. **Impact depends on the extent of the user's position but could lead to insolvency in edge cases.**

---

### **Mitigation:**  
Add a validation step in `executeRepay` to ensure the caller’s `aTokens` balance is at least equal to `params.amount` when `useATokens = true`.
