# Excessive Repayment Amount Not Checked in `validateRepay`, Leading to Potential User Fund Loss

### Summary:
In `validateRepay`, the lack of a check to ensure that `amountSent` does not exceed `debt` will cause a loss of funds for users as excess repayments may be locked or mismanaged.

---

### Root Cause:
In `ValidationLogic.sol:469`, the `validateRepay` function checks that `amountSent` [is non-zero](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L294) and that the user [has an outstanding `debt`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L308). However, it does not verify if `amountSent` exceeds the `debt`. Without this check, any excess amount sent beyond the user's debt is accepted without proper handling, leading to potential loss or locking of funds. This omission can cause discrepancies in fund management and result in users losing their excess repayments.

---

### Internal Pre-conditions:
1. A user must call `repay()` to send a repayment amount (`amountSent`).
2. The user must have a debt (`debt`) greater than zero.

---

### External Pre-conditions:
1. No external conditions are required as this is an internal logic issue.

---

### Attack Path:
1. The user calls `repay()` with an `amountSent` greater than the actual `debt`.
2. The `validateRepay` function processes the repayment without checking if `amountSent` exceeds the `debt`.
3. The excess funds are not properly handled, leading to potential loss or mismanagement.

---

### Impact:
The user suffers an approximate loss equal to the excess amount sent over the actual debt. The protocol locks or mismanages these excess funds.

---

### Mitigation:
Add a check in `validateRepay` to ensure that `amountSent` does not exceed the user's `debt`.
