# Bypass of Liquidation Mechanism via Repayment with Low Health Factor

### Summary

The protocol allows borrowers to repay their loans even when their health factor is below the `HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD`, which is the condition for liquidation. This creates an opportunity for users to front-run liquidators by making a partial repayment to improve their health factor and avoid liquidation, negatively impacting liquidators.

### Root Cause

The protocol does not perform a health factor check during the repayment process. This oversight allows borrowers with a low health factor (below the liquidation threshold) to bypass liquidation by repaying a small amount of debt, artificially improving their health factor before liquidators can act.



### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

- Health Factor Below Threshold: A borrower’s health factor drops below the `HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD`, making them eligible for liquidation.
- Front-Running Liquidators: The borrower identifies a pending liquidation attempt and executes a partial repayment (or complete repayment) transaction before the liquidation occurs.
- Health Factor Improvement: The partial repayment increases the borrower’s health factor above the threshold, making liquidation no longer possible.
- Liquidators Impacted: Liquidators are unable to execute the liquidation, losing potential profits

### Impact

- Reduced Liquidator Incentive: Liquidators are discouraged from participating in the system as their profitability depends on timely liquidation opportunities.

### PoC

paste in tests/protocol/pool/Pool.Liquidations.t.sol
```solidity
function test_mytest2() public {
    uint256 supplyAmount = 0.5e8;
    uint256 borrowAmount = 11000e6;

    vm.startPrank(alice);
    contracts.poolProxy.supply(tokenList.wbtc, supplyAmount, alice, 0);
    contracts.poolProxy.borrow(tokenList.usdx, borrowAmount, 2, 0, alice);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.warp(block.timestamp + 30 days);
    LiquidationInput memory params = _loadLiquidationInput(
      alice,
      tokenList.wbtc,
      tokenList.usdx,
      UINT256_MAX,
      tokenList.wbtc,
      16_00
    );

    vm.prank(alice);
    contracts.poolProxy.repay(tokenList.usdx, UINT256_MAX, 2, alice);
  }
```

### Mitigation

Health Factor Check During Repay: Implement a check during the repayment process to ensure the health factor is above the `HEALTH_FACTOR_LIQUIDATION_THRESHOLD` before allowing the transaction to proceed.
