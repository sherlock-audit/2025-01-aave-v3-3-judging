# Incorrect Fee Handling for `executeBackUnbacked` When `amount > reserve.unbacked`

### **Summary**  
In `BridgeLogic.sol`, the function calculates `backingAmount` as the lesser of `amount` or `reserve.unbacked`, but it does not adjust the fee proportionately to match the `backingAmount`, which will cause **overpayment of fees** for **backers** as the **protocol charges fees on the full `amount` instead of the actual `backingAmount`**.

---

### **Root Cause**  
In `BridgeLogic.sol`, [the line](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BridgeLogic.sol#L132):  
```solidity
uint256 backingAmount = (amount < reserve.unbacked) ? amount : reserve.unbacked;
```
correctly limits `backingAmount` to `reserve.unbacked`. However, the `fee` remains based on the [original `amount`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BridgeLogic.sol#L136):  
```solidity
uint256 added = backingAmount + fee;
```
This overcharges fees when `amount > reserve.unbacked`.

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**  
1. **User** calls `executeBackUnbacked` with `amount` greater than `reserve.unbacked`.  
2. The reserve has an `unbacked` amount less than the requested `amount`.  

---

### **External Pre-conditions**  
1. The **caller** has approved sufficient tokens to cover `amount + fee` to the `aToken` contract.  

---

### **Attack Path**  
1. A backer calls `executeBackUnbacked` with an `amount` significantly larger than `reserve.unbacked` (e.g., `amount = 1000`, `reserve.unbacked = 100`).
2. The function limits the `backingAmount` to `100`, but the `fee` is still calculated for the full `amount = 1000`.
3. The backer is forced to pay an excessive fee disproportionate to the actual `backingAmount`.

---

### **Impact**  
The **backer** suffers **excessive fee payments**, causing inefficiencies and potentially deterring liquidity provision. For example:
- If the `protocolFeeBps` is 100 (1%) and `fee = 10` for `amount = 1000`, the backer pays `fee = 10` instead of `fee = 1` for `backingAmount = 100`.  

---

### **Mitigation**  
Adjust the `fee` proportionally to match the `backingAmount`:
```solidity
if (amount > reserve.unbacked) {
    fee = fee.percentMul(reserve.unbacked).percentDiv(amount);
}
```
