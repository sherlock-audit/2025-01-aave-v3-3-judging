# Attackers can manipulate oracle prices through flash loans

### Summary

Oracle price manipulation through flash loans will cause incorrect debt valuations since the borrow validation relies on oracle prices without flash loan protection


### Root Cause

The executeRepay() function lacks flash loan protection when validating repayment amounts and prices in ValidationLogic.validateRepay()

in (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L78-L96) Price validation happens here without flash loan checks

In (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L190-L195) Interest rate updates that could be manipulated



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. Attacker needs to have ability to take flash loans
2. Oracle prices must not have flash loan protection
3. Asset must have sufficient liquidity in lending pools

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. Attacker takes large flash loan of the collateral asset
2. Manipulates oracle price through large trades
3. Uses manipulated price to borrow at advantageous rates
4. Repays flash loan
5. Profits from price discrepancy

### Impact

* Protocol could suffer large losses as attackers can:
  - Borrow more than their collateral should allow
  - Manipulate liquidation thresholds
  - Extract value through price manipulation

### PoC

```solidity
contract FlashLoanAttack {
    function executeAttack() external {
        // 1. Take flash loan
        uint256 flashAmount = 1000000 ether;
        flashLender.borrow(flashAmount);
        
        // 2. Manipulate price
        swapExact(flashAmount, router);
        
        // 3. Borrow with manipulated price
        borrowLogic.executeBorrow(...);
        
        // 4. Repay flash loan
        flashLender.repay(flashAmount);
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

```solidity
// Add to BorrowLogic.sol
uint256 private constant FLASH_LOAN_GRACE_PERIOD = 1; // 1 block

mapping(address => uint256) private lastBorrowBlock;

function executeBorrow(...) external {
    // Add flash loan protection
    require(
        block.number > lastBorrowBlock[params.onBehalfOf] + FLASH_LOAN_GRACE_PERIOD,
        "FLASH_LOAN_GRACE_PERIOD"
    );
    lastBorrowBlock[params.onBehalfOf] = block.number;
    
    // Rest of the function...
}
```
