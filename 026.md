# Incorrect Handling of Debt Ceiling in Isolation Mode Allows Over-Borrowing

### Summary  
The failure to correctly adjust the `isolationModeTotalDebt` when borrowing in isolation mode will cause an over-borrowing vulnerability for isolated assets as the protocol will miscalculate the debt ceiling and allow users to exceed the intended borrowing limits.

---

### Root Cause  
In BorrowLogic.sol, the [isolationModeTotalDebt](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L110-L114) calculation incorrectly assumes that the borrowed amount (`params.amount`) can be directly scaled without verifying the decimals of the isolated asset.  

#### Code Snippet:  
```solidity  
uint256 nextIsolationModeTotalDebt = reservesData[isolationModeCollateralAddress]
    .isolationModeTotalDebt += (params.amount / 
    10 ** (reserveCache.reserveConfiguration.getDecimals() - 
    ReserveConfiguration.DEBT_CEILING_DECIMALS)).toUint128();
```

The calculation assumes that `getDecimals()` for the reserve and `DEBT_CEILING_DECIMALS` will align correctly for every isolated asset. If there is a mismatch in decimals or if the borrowed amount is not properly scaled, the `isolationModeTotalDebt` can be incorrectly calculated, allowing users to bypass the debt ceiling.  

---

### Internal Pre-conditions  
1. The **reserve** is configured in isolation mode with a defined `debt ceiling`.  
2. The **user** borrows an amount that exceeds the scaled ceiling when miscalculated.  

---

### External Pre-conditions  
1. The isolated asset has a mismatch between its internal decimals and the expected `DEBT_CEILING_DECIMALS`.  

---

### Attack Path  
1. **User** borrows an amount in isolation mode with a large enough value to exploit the miscalculation.  
2. The protocol updates `isolationModeTotalDebt` with an incorrectly scaled value due to decimal mismatch.  
3. The attacker repeats the process to borrow more than the actual debt ceiling, potentially draining the protocol's reserves.  

---

### Impact  
The **protocol reserves** for isolated assets are over-utilized, bypassing intended risk controls. Depositors are exposed to significant risks as reserves may be depleted due to excessive borrowing.  

---

### Mitigation  
Ensure proper scaling of `params.amount` by verifying and aligning decimals explicitly.
