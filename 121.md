# Protocol allows users to liquidate their own undercollateralized positions.

### Summary

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L200

The current code allows users to liquidate their own undercollateralized positions.
There's no check to prevent a user (the borrower) from acting as the liquidator for themselves. Borrowers can intentionally become undercollateralized. They can then liquidate themselves and receive the liquidation bonus. This allows them to profit unfairly from the protocol, which is not the intended use of the liquidation system.

### Root Cause

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L200

   function executeLiquidationCall(
    mapping(address => DataTypes.ReserveData) storage reservesData,
    mapping(uint256 => address) storage reservesList,
    mapping(address => DataTypes.UserConfigurationMap) storage usersConfig,
    mapping(uint8 => DataTypes.EModeCategory) storage eModeCategories,
    DataTypes.ExecuteLiquidationCallParams memory params
  ) external {
    LiquidationCallLocalVars memory vars;


    DataTypes.ReserveData storage collateralReserve = reservesData[params.collateralAsset];
    DataTypes.ReserveData storage debtReserve = reservesData[params.debtAsset];
    DataTypes.UserConfigurationMap storage userConfig = usersConfig[params.user];
    vars.debtReserveCache = debtReserve.cache();
    debtReserve.updateState(vars.debtReserveCache);


    (
      vars.totalCollateralInBaseCurrency,
      vars.totalDebtInBaseCurrency,
      ,
      ,
      vars.healthFactor,


    ) = GenericLogic.calculateUserAccountData(
      reservesData,
      reservesList,
      eModeCategories,
      DataTypes.CalculateUserAccountDataParams({
        userConfig: userConfig,
        reservesCount: params.reservesCount,
        user: params.user,
        oracle: params.priceOracle,
        userEModeCategory: params.userEModeCategory
      })
    );

The function does not check if the liquidator (msg.sender) is the same as the borrower (params.user).
This omission allows self-liquidation

Example:
The user intentionally borrows close to their maximum limit or manipulates volatile collateral to reduce their Health Factor below 1
The user calls executeLiquidationCall, passing their own address as the borrower (params.user).
The function processes the liquidation, and the user receives their own collateral back, plus the liquidation bonus.
The user gains extra assets through the bonus without any third-party involvement.


### Internal Pre-conditions

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

Alice supplies 100 ETH worth of collateral and borrows 75 ETH worth of a stablecoin.
She manipulates the market or uses a volatile asset to decrease the value of her collateral, dropping her Health Factor below 1.
Alice then calls executeLiquidationCall, targeting herself as the borrower.
She repays part of her own debt.
Receives a portion of her collateral back, plus the liquidation bonus.
Effectively increases her net assets by the amount of the liquidation bonus

### Impact

The borrower profits from an action intended to penalize undercollateralization and incentivize third-party liquidators.
This undermines the economic incentives and risk mitigation mechanisms of the protocol.

The liquidation bonus is designed as a reward for external liquidators to maintain the protocol's health.
Borrowers should not be able to benefit from their own liquidation.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

Add a condition in the executeLiquidationCall function to prevent self-liquidation.
