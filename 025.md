# Failure to Include Borrowed Amount in `liquidityTaken` Causes Reserve Imbalances and Incorrect Interest Rates

### Summary  
A missing inclusion of `params.amount` in `liquidityTaken` during interest rate and virtual balance updates will cause reserve imbalances for depositors as the protocol will fail to reflect accurate utilization and interest rates, allowing borrowers to exploit artificially low borrowing costs.

---

### Root Cause  
In BorrowLogic.sol, the following call to [updateInterestRatesAndVirtualBalance](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L121-L126) does not account for the borrowed amount (`params.amount`) in `liquidityTaken` when `params.releaseUnderlying` is [false](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L125):  

```solidity  
reserve.updateInterestRatesAndVirtualBalance(
    reserveCache,
    params.asset,
    0, // liquidityAdded
    params.releaseUnderlying ? params.amount : 0 // liquidityTaken
);
```  

The `liquidityTaken` parameter must always include `params.amount`, as borrowing reduces available liquidity regardless of the `releaseUnderlying` flag.  
This logic incorrectly skips updating reserve utilization and interest rates for the borrowed amount when `releaseUnderlying` is `false`. However, borrowing always reduces available liquidity (`liquidityTaken`), regardless of whether the underlying asset is physically released. As a result, reserves are left in an inconsistent state with inaccurate utilization rates and miscalculated interest rates.

This is a clear oversight, as the `updateInterestRatesAndVirtualBalance` function explicitly relies on `liquidityTaken` to calculate new rates and balances, meaning the omission directly causes reserve imbalances.

---

### Internal Pre-conditions  
1. **Borrower** calls `executeBorrow()` with `params.releaseUnderlying` set to `false`.  
2. The `params.amount` borrowed is greater than 0.  

---

### External Pre-conditions  
1. The reserve is active and has sufficient liquidity to allow borrowing.  
2. The protocol uses virtual accounting for the reserve (if applicable).  

---

### Attack Path  
1. **Borrower** initiates a borrow transaction with `releaseUnderlying` set to `false`.  
2. The borrowed amount is not reflected in `liquidityTaken`.  
3. The protocol fails to update interest rates and virtual balances accurately.  
4. Borrowers exploit artificially low interest rates, draining liquidity and reducing depositor returns.  

---

### Impact  
The **protocol reserves** suffer an imbalance where utilization rates are under-calculated, and interest rates are too low. Borrowers gain unfairly reduced borrowing costs, potentially depleting reserves and diminishing depositor yields.  

---

### Mitigation  
Update `executeBorrow` to always include `params.amount` in `liquidityTaken` when calling `updateInterestRatesAndVirtualBalance`.
