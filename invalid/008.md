# Lack of Direct Liquidity Check in Aave V3 Borrowing Logic

### Summary

##  Critical Liquidity Vulnerability in Aave V3 [`BorrowingLogic`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L60)  and [`validateBorrow`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L137)

A  vulnerability exists in Aave V3's borrowing logic due to the lack of a direct liquidity check in validateBorrow and executeBorrow. The protocol incorrectly relies on the borrowCap as a proxy for available liquidity, which is a limit on total debt, not a guarantee of sufficient underlying assets.

This flaw could  leads to:
* executeBorrow assuming sufficient liquidity after validation, which is false.
* executeBorrow assuming successful asset transfer, which can fail if liquidity is low.
* executeRepay potentially failing to reconcile debt due to inconsistent accounting
*  Risk of reserve depletion, inconsistent accounting

### Root Cause

##### Absence of Liquidity Check in validateBorrow:
 The [`validateBorrow function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ValidationLogic.sol#L137) which is responsible for validating borrow requests, does not include a direct check to ensure that the reserve has enough underlying assets to fulfill the request. It only checks if the total debt (including the new borrow) is within the borrowCap and other parameters. . It relies solely on the borrowCap as a proxy for liquidity, which is a flawed assumption.

##### Deferred Asset Transfer in executeBorrow: 
The [`executeBorrow function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L60) attempts to transfer the underlying asset after validation, without checking if the reserve actually has enough assets. This deferred transfer exacerbates the issue, as the system assumes the transfer will succeed without verifying the availability of assets.

##### Lack of Direct Liquidity Tracking:
The protocol does not implement a mechanism to track the real-time available liquidity of the underlying asset. This means that the system is unaware of the actual amount of assets available for borrowing and relies solely on the borrowCap as an indirect measure.



### Internal Pre-conditions

##### Reserve with Low Underlying Asset Liquidity:
 The reserve must have a low amount of its underlying asset available for borrowing, relative to its borrowCap. This can occur due to previous borrows, withdrawals, or other factors that reduce the reserve's balance.
Why it's a precondition: If the reserve has ample liquidity, the lack of a direct check might not be immediately exploitable. The vulnerability becomes apparent when the reserve's liquidity is low.

##### borrowCap Set Higher Than Actual Liquidity:
The borrowCap for the reserve must be set to a value that is higher than the actual amount of underlying assets held by the reserve.
Why it's a precondition: If the borrowCap is set lower than or equal to the actual liquidity, the vulnerability is less likely to be triggered. The discrepancy between the borrowCap and actual liquidity is what allows the exploit.

##### Borrow Request Exceeding Available Liquidity:
 A user must attempt to borrow an amount of the underlying asset that exceeds the actual available liquidity in the reserve.
Why it's a precondition: If the borrow request is within the available liquidity, the vulnerability might not be triggered. The exploit relies on the borrow request exceeding the actual available assets.

### External Pre-conditions

##### Attacker's Ability to Interact with the Protocol:
The attacker must have the ability to interact with the Aave V3 protocol, specifically the ability to call the borrow function.
This is a basic requirement for any  exploit. The attacker needs to be able to send transactions to the protocol.

##### Attacker's Knowledge of Vulnerable Reserves:
 The attacker needs to be aware of reserves that have low underlying asset liquidity and a borrowCap set higher than the actual liquidity.
The attacker needs to target a specific reserve that is vulnerable to this exploit. This requires some level of on-chain analysis or monitoring.

##### Attacker's Ability to Meet Collateral Requirements:
The attacker must have sufficient collateral to meet the protocol's requirements for borrowing.
The attacker needs to have enough collateral to pass the collateral checks in validateBorrow. This is a standard requirement for borrowing in Aave.

### Impact

##### Inconsistent Accounting
 If the releaseUnderlying parameter is set to false during a borrow, users might receive debt tokens without receiving the corresponding underlying assets.
Impact: This creates a situation where the protocol's accounting becomes inconsistent. The debt tokens are not backed by actual assets, which can lead to confusion, disputes, and potential manipulation.

##### Loss of Funds for Users:
 Users who attempt to withdraw their supplied assets from a depleted reserve might not be able to get their funds back.
Impact: This is a direct financial loss for users who have supplied assets to the protocol. It can erode trust in the platform and lead to a decline in user participation.

#### Reserve Depletion:
A malicious actor or a series of large borrow requests could potentially deplete a reserve of its underlying assets.
Impact: This would make it impossible for other users to withdraw their supplied assets or borrow from the reserve. It could lead to a loss of confidence in the protocol and a potential bank run.

### Mitigation

* Implement Direct Liquidity Check in validateBorrow
* track the real-time available liquidity of the underlying asset in each reserv
