# Missing Revert on Failed Permit in supplyWithPermit function in pool.sol

### Summary

The [`supplyWithPermit function`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/pool/Pool.sol#L165) allows users to supply assets with a signature-based permit. However, if the IERC20WithPermit(asset).permit call fails (e.g., due to an invalid signature, expired deadline, or unsupported permit feature), the try-catch block suppresses the error and allows the function to proceed with executeSupply. This behavior bypasses the intent of requiring a valid permit and could lead to unauthorized asset transfers if the permit validation fails.

Additionally, if supplyCap == 0 in the validateSupply logic, an attacker could exploit the lack of supply cap enforcement, leading to overflows in the supply logic. This combination of issues poses a risk to the protocol's integrity and token holders' funds.

### Root Cause

Weak Permit Validation: The try-catch block around the permit function call prevents the transaction from reverting even when the permit is invalid (e.g. due to an expired signature, incorrect nonce, or signature mismatch). This allows the transaction to proceed, bypassing the expected checks for a valid permit.

No Supply Cap Enforcement: The check for supplyCap == 0 in the validateSupply function allows the system to bypass any enforcement of a supply cap if it is set to zero. This results in a failure to properly restrict the total supply of the asset, making it possible for an attacker to bypass supply limitations and exploit the system

### Internal Pre-conditions

Valid Permit Parameters:

* The attacker must craft a valid transaction with a forged or expired permit signature. This could involve manipulating the permit data (e.g., permitV, permitR, permitS) in such a way that it is accepted by the permit function without causing a revert. Since the try-catch block suppresses reverts, invalid signatures or expired permits will not cause the transaction to fail.

* The system must have the supplyCap set to 0. This is a crucial pre-condition because, when supplyCap equals zero, the enforcement of the supply cap is bypassed, and no validation will take place to prevent the asset from being over-supplied.


* The attacker needs to target a specific reserve and asset with which they want to exploit the vulnerability. This would typically require knowledge of the systemâ€™s current reserve configuration and the asset details (e.g., aTokenAddress and other reserve-related parameters).


* The attacker must ensure that the onBehalfOf address is valid and recognized by the contract to avoid the onBehalfOf address being the same as the aTokenAddress, which would trigger an error.


* The attacker must have access to call the supplyWithPermit function, which implies they need to be a user or participant of the system (or have the ability to send transactions to the smart contract) without triggering a revert due to permissioning or access control restrictions.

### External Pre-conditions




### Attack Path

* Submitting a malicious or invalid permit signature that fails silently.
* Bypassing the permit validation due to the try-catch block.
* Executing the supply logic without the valid signature.
* Bypassing the supply cap enforcement if supplyCap == 0.
* Transferring and minting aTokens to exploit the system for excessive liquidity or collateral

### Impact


##### Supply Cap Violation
 * Bypassing the supply cap due to supplyCap == 0
     Inflation of the Token Supply
     Market Manipulation


*   Protocol Integrity
       Disruption of Protocol Mechanics
       Depletion of Reserve Funds

* Collateral Exploitation
    The attacker may use the newly supplied tokens as collateral for further borrowing or leveraging, thus exploiting the system for unearned profit without adhering to the intended supply constraints
    

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

##### Fix the try-catch Block Handling
  The current implementation allows for the execution of the SupplyLogic.executeSupply function even if the permit fails, bypassing important checks and potentially altering the state in an unintended way.

A better approach is to require the permit to succeed before moving forward with the rest of the supply logic.
