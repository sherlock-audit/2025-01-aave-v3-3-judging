# Using latestAnswer to get asset prices from chainlink is deprecated, consider using latestRoundData

### Summary

Using `AggregatorInterface`s `latestAnswer()` is deprecated and allows for the received data to be stale. Consider using latestRoundData to verify that the received price is not stale.

### Root Cause

In [`AaveOracle.sol::getAssetPrice()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/misc/AaveOracle.sol#L109) ,`latestAnswer()` is used. 
[`LiquidationLogic.sol::executeLiquidationCall()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L200) heavily relies on the `getAssetPrice()` function to get both collateral and debt value. It is also used in [`calculateUserAccountData()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/GenericLogic.sol#L63) and in [`validateBorrow()`](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/8da00c84076db02af24bfe20cc6b99e6738f743f/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BorrowLogic.sol#L78). Those values could be not up to date to the current market price since the received price is not checked for being up to date.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

1. Received Price is stale.

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

The protocol wrongfully assumes that the received price is up to date which can lead to inconsistencies in debt and collateral calculations which in result could lead to other problems associated with borrowing and liquidations.

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

  Consider using `latestRoundData()` instead of `latestAnswer()` and check if the price is stale.
```diff
  function getAssetPrice(address asset) public view override returns (uint256) {
    AggregatorInterface source = assetsSources[asset];

    if (asset == BASE_CURRENCY) {
      return BASE_CURRENCY_UNIT;
    } else if (address(source) == address(0)) {
      return _fallbackOracle.getAssetPrice(asset);
    } else {
-     int256 price = source.latestAnswer();
+    (uint256 roundId, int256 price,, uint256 updatedAt, uint80 answeredInRound) = source.latestRoundData();
+    require(updatedAt >= block.timestamp - 1 hours, "Stale price"); //or other time offset

      if (price > 0) {
        return uint256(price);
      } else {
        return _fallbackOracle.getAssetPrice(asset);
      }
    }
  }
  ```
