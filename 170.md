# Incorrect Scaled Debt Variable Usage in Treasury Accrual Leads to Fee Loss

## Summary
When calculating interest accrual to the treasury in the `_accrueToTreasury` function, the contract incorrectly uses the same scaled debt value (`currScaledVariableDebt`) for both previous and current debt calculations, instead of accounting for changes in the total debt between updates.

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/ReserveLogic.sol#L217

```solidity
uint256 prevTotalVariableDebt = reserveCache.currScaledVariableDebt.rayMul(
    reserveCache.currVariableBorrowIndex
);

uint256 currTotalVariableDebt = reserveCache.currScaledVariableDebt.rayMul(
    reserveCache.nextVariableBorrowIndex
);
```

This creates a critical accounting error in the protocol's interest calculations when the total scaled debt changes between updates (due to new borrows or repayments). The function fails to capture these debt changes in its calculations, leading to:

1. Under-accrual of interest to the treasury when new debt is added - because the new debt amount isn't included in the calculation
2. Over-accrual of interest when debt is repaid - because the reduced debt isn't reflected in the calculation

## Scenario

1. A borrower takes out a variable rate loan of 1000 USDC at time T0
- Initial currScaledVariableDebt = 1000
- currVariableBorrowIndex = 1.0

2. At time T1, the borrower adds another 500 USDC loan:
- nextScaledVariableDebt should be 1500
- nextVariableBorrowIndex = 1.1 (due to interest accrual)

3. The _accrueToTreasury calculation executes:
```solidity
prevTotalVariableDebt = 1000 * 1.0 = 1000 USDC
currTotalVariableDebt = 1000 * 1.1 = 1100 USDC  // Uses currScaledVariableDebt instead of 1500
totalDebtAccrued = 1100 - 1000 = 100 USDC
```

4. Actual correct calculation should be:
```solidity
prevTotalVariableDebt = 1000 * 1.0 = 1000 USDC
currTotalVariableDebt = 1500 * 1.1 = 1650 USDC  // Using nextScaledVariableDebt
totalDebtAccrued = 1650 - 1000 = 650 USDC
```

5. Result:
- Treasury receives interest on 100 USDC instead of 650 USDC
- Missing accrual: 550 USDC (84.6% of expected interest)
- This compounds with each subsequent interest calculation cycle

This demonstrates how the miscalculation creates an expanding delta between expected and actual treasury accruals, with the severity scaling proportionally to debt position sizes and update frequency.

## Impact

The impact is severe as the protocol's treasury accrual mechanism becomes fundamentally flawed, with each interest calculation cycle propagating and amplifying the accounting discrepancy. This creates a compounding error effect where subsequent calculations build upon incorrect accrual values, leading to an expanding deviation from the intended economic model. In extreme scenarios with significant borrowing volume, this could precipitate protocol insolvency by severely undermining the treasury's ability to accurately account for and collect protocol fees. The systemic nature of this miscalculation particularly impacts high-value debt positions, where even small percentage errors translate to substantial absolute value discrepancies in the protocol's financial accounting.

## Recommended mitigation steps
Update the `_accrueToTreasury` function to use different scaled debt values for previous and current calculations:

```solidity
uint256 prevTotalVariableDebt = reserveCache.currScaledVariableDebt.rayMul(
    reserveCache.currVariableBorrowIndex
);

uint256 currTotalVariableDebt = reserveCache.nextScaledVariableDebt.rayMul(
    reserveCache.nextVariableBorrowIndex
);
```

This ensures that:
1. Previous debt calculation uses the old scaled debt (`currScaledVariableDebt`)
2. Current debt calculation uses the new scaled debt (`nextScaledVariableDebt`)
