# Missing Health Factor Validation in Collateral Disabling Allows Forced Liquidations Through Deficit Elimination for Non-Virtual Assets

### Description
In `LiquidationLogic.sol`, the `executeEliminateDeficit()` function contains a critical vulnerability where eliminating an account's entire balance automatically disables that asset as collateral, without checking if this would make the user's position unsafe. This can be exploited to force liquidations of otherwise healthy positions.

It's important to note that while only the Umbrella contract can initiate deficit elimination, it has the power to burn aTokens from any user's balance. This happens through the Pool contract:

https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/pool/Pool.sol#L73

```solidity
modifier onlyUmbrella() {
    require(ADDRESSES_PROVIDER.getAddress(UMBRELLA) == msg.sender, Errors.CALLER_NOT_UMBRELLA);
    _;
}
```


The burn operation is executed through the aToken contract:


```solidity
function burn(
    address from,            // Can be any user's address
    address receiverOfUnderlying,
    uint256 amount,
    uint256 index
) external virtual override onlyPool {
    _burnScaled(from, receiverOfUnderlying, amount, index);
    // ...
}
```

The vulnerable code that triggers collateral disabling:

```solidity 
if (isCollateral && balanceWriteOff == userBalance) {
    userConfig.setUsingAsCollateral(reserve.id, false);
    emit ReserveUsedAsCollateralDisabled(params.asset, msg.sender);
}
```

The function disables an asset as collateral whenever the entire balance is written off, without:
1. Checking the user's overall health factor
2. Validating if removing this collateral would make the position unsafe
3. Allowing users to prevent their collateral from being disabled

The severity of this issue varies by asset type:
- For assets with virtual accounting, the impact is limited as utilization calculations use virtual balances
- However, non-virtual assets like GHO are fully vulnerable as they directly affect pool utilization

### Scenario
This vulnerability can be exploited to force liquidations through the following attack path:

To illustrate the risk, consider a typical user position:

100,000 GHO as collateral (non-virtual asset)
80,000 USDC borrowed
Health factor of 1.2 (safely over-collateralized)

When a deficit elimination targets GHO, this user's entire GHO balance could be burned and automatically disabled as collateral, instantly making their position unsafe despite no market movement.

An attacker can exploit this through the following steps:

1. Attacker identifies accounts using the deficit-affected asset as collateral that are close to but above liquidation threshold
2. When a large deficit elimination is incoming, attacker:
   - Front-runs with a flash loan
   - Takes leveraged positions against target accounts' collateral
3. Deficit elimination executes, disabling collateral
4. Attacker back-runs by:
   - Liquidating now-unsafe positions at a discount
   - Profiting from liquidation bonuses
   - Repaying flash loan

### Impact
This creates a severe risk pattern that compounds through the liquidation mechanism. When collateral is forcibly disabled via deficit elimination, positions that were safely over-collateralized suddenly become vulnerable to liquidation without any market movement or user action. The attacker exploits this artificial position deterioration by using flash loans to immediately liquidate the now-unsafe positions, capturing the liquidation bonus that would normally only be available during legitimate market stress.

The economic impact is significant:

- Typical liquidation bonuses in Aave range from 5-10%
- On a 100,000 GHO position, attackers could extract 5,000-10,000 GHO in pure profit
- Target-rich environment: Any position using non-virtual assets (like GHO) as collateral with health factor between 1.0-1.2
- Large positions are particularly vulnerable as they're likely to use maximum leverage

For context, a user with a $1M position using maximum allowed LTV could be forced into liquidation, with attackers extracting $50,000-$100,000 in liquidation bonuses, despite the position being perfectly healthy under normal market conditions.

The unfairness is exacerbated because these liquidations occur despite no actual change in the underlying asset's value or market conditions, representing a pure transfer of value from legitimate users to opportunistic attackers who can monitor and react to deficit elimination transactions. This dynamic fundamentally breaks the protocol's liquidation mechanism which is designed to trigger only due to actual market risk, not administrative actions.

### Recommended Mitigation Steps

1. Add health factor validation before disabling collateral:
```solidity
if (isCollateral && balanceWriteOff == userBalance) {
    (,,,,, uint256 healthFactor) = pool.getUserAccountData(user);
    require(healthFactor >= MINIMUM_HEALTH_FACTOR, "Would make position unsafe");
    userConfig.setUsingAsCollateral(reserve.id, false);
    emit ReserveUsedAsCollateralDisabled(params.asset, msg.sender);
}
```

2. Allow users to optionally keep the asset as collateral even after deficit elimination:
```solidity
function executeEliminateDeficit(
    ...
    bool keepAsCollateral
) {
    ...
    if (isCollateral && balanceWriteOff == userBalance && !keepAsCollateral) {
        // Existing collateral disable logic
    }
}
```

3. Implement gradual deficit elimination to prevent large sudden changes:
```solidity
require(
    balanceWriteOff <= reserve.deficit.percentMul(MAX_ELIMINATION_PERCENT_PER_TX),
    "Elimination too large"
);
```

The recommended health factor validation is particularly important for non-virtual assets:

- For virtual assets (most assets in Aave), the collateral disabling has limited impact on utilization
- For non-virtual assets like GHO, extra protection is critical as they lack virtual balance protection
- The gradual elimination approach gives users time to adjust positions and maintain health factors

Implementation note: The MINIMUM_HEALTH_FACTOR should be set conservatively, recommended at 1.1 to provide safety margin above liquidation threshold.
