# Grace period set on reserves will affect correct liquidations after `MIN_LEFTOVER_BASE` introduction

### Summary

During a liquidation call, if any of the reserves is in a grace period, its debt balance is still accounted for and present in the `vars.totalDebtInBaseCurrency` variable during the execution of the `executeLiquidationCall()` function.

This leads to overinflated `maxLiquidatableDebt` calculations, causing the liquidation call to revert in situations where that value is used and brings the debt below the `MIN_LEFTOVER_BASE` minimum debt amount when full debt liquidation is not possible.

### Root Cause

The `vars.totalDebtInBaseCurrency` value is overinflated with debt from reserves in a grace period, leading to incorrect calculations of `maxLiquidatableDebt`.

### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User has debt in multiple reserves.
2. Grace period is set on some of the reserves.
3. User HF is below 1 but above 0.95.
4. The reserve in debt has more than 50% of the overall debt and is above the `MIN_BASE_MAX_CLOSE_FACTOR_THRESHOLD`.
5. Reserve collateral not in the grace period is slightly above the reserve debt.

### External Pre-conditions

None.

### Attack Path

1. Liquidator calls the `liquidationCall()` with the entire reserve debt amount, expecting to liquidate the maximum liquidatable debt possible.
2. The liquidation call reverts due to the `MUST_NOT_LEAVE_DUST` error.

### Impact

Liquidations behave unexpectedly when some of the reserves cannot be used due to the grace period.

### PoC

Add the following to `Pool.Liquidations.CloseFactor.t.sol` to demonstrate the issue:

```solidity
function test_PoC_Grace_Period() external {
    _supplyToPool(tokenList.usdx, bob, 2100e6);
    _supplyToPool(tokenList.wbtc, bob, 15e5);
    _supplyToPool(tokenList.weth, bob, 1 ether);
    vm.prank(bob);
    contracts.poolProxy.borrow(tokenList.usdx, 2050e6, 2, 0, bob);
    _borrowToBeBelowHf(bob, tokenList.weth, 0.97 ether);

    vm.startPrank(poolAdmin);
      contracts.poolConfiguratorProxy.setReservePause(tokenList.wbtc, false, 2 hours);
      contracts.poolConfiguratorProxy.setReservePause(tokenList.weth, false, 2 hours);
    vm.stopPrank();

    vm.prank(liquidator);
    IERC20Detailed(tokenList.usdx).approve(address(contracts.poolProxy), type(uint256).max);
    vm.startPrank(liquidator);

    vm.expectRevert(bytes(Errors.MUST_NOT_LEAVE_DUST));
    contracts.poolProxy.liquidationCall(
      tokenList.usdx,
      tokenList.usdx,
      bob,
      2050e6,
      false
    );
}
```

### Mitigation

- Do not account for debt from reserves in a grace period in the `vars.totalDebtInBaseCurrency` calculations.
- Alternatively, use half of the selected debt reserve as `maxLiquidatableDebt` if the original `maxLiquidatableDebt` calculation results in `vars.userReserveDebt - maxLiquidatableDebt < MIN_LEFTOVER_BASE`.
