# Users may lose funds due to unchecked pool withdrawal returns

### Summary

Unused return value from `POOL.withdraw()` may cause potential fund loss as the contract doesn't verify if the withdrawal was successful before proceeding with WETH conversion.



### Root Cause

In src/contracts/helpers/WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol#65 (https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/helpers/WrappedTokenGatewayV3.sol#L65) the `POOL.withdraw()` return value is ignored:

```solidity
POOL.withdraw(address(WETH), amountToWithdraw, address(this));
```



### Internal Pre-conditions

1. User must have sufficient `aWETH` balance
2. `POOL.withdraw` must be able to return false without reverting


### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

1. User initiates withdrawal through `withdrawETH()`
2. `POOL.withdraw()` fails but returns false
3. Contract continues execution with failed withdrawal
4. Subsequent WETH operations fail or create inconsistent state

### Impact

1. Users may lose their tokens if pool withdrawal fails silently
2. Contract state becomes inconsistent between aWETH and WETH

### PoC

```solidity
contract MockPool {
    function withdraw(address asset, uint256 amount, address to) external returns (bool) {
        // Simulate failed withdrawal
        return false;
    }
}

contract WithdrawReturnPoC {
    WrappedTokenGatewayV3 gateway;
    
    function testUncheckedWithdraw() public {
        MockPool pool = new MockPool();
        uint256 amount = 1 ether;
        
        // Withdrawal fails but continues
        gateway.withdrawETH(address(pool), amount, address(this));
        // State becomes inconsistent
    }
}
```

### Mitigation

Add return value check

```solidity
bool success = POOL.withdraw(address(WETH), amountToWithdraw, address(this));
require(success, "Pool withdrawal failed");
```
