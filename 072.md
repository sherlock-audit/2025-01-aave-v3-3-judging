# Improper Enforcement of `interestRateMode

### **Summary**

The `validateBorrow` and `validateRepay` functions enforce the use of `InterestRateMode.VARIABLE` by explicitly restricting the `interestRateMode` to `VARIABLE`. This approach implicitly assumes that fixed interest rate borrowing is disabled, which may unnecessarily restrict legitimate use cases where fixed interest rates could be supported.

---

### **Description**

In the `validateBorrow` and `validateRepay` functions, the following check enforces that only `InterestRateMode.VARIABLE` is allowed:

```solidity
require(
    params.interestRateMode == DataTypes.InterestRateMode.VARIABLE,
    Errors.INVALID_INTEREST_RATE_MODE_SELECTED
);
```

This requirement prevents the selection of `InterestRateMode.STABLE` for borrowing or repaying, potentially limiting the flexibility of the protocol. While this may align with the current design choice of the system, it fails to accommodate scenarios where both variable and stable interest rate borrowing might be enabled in the future or in specific configurations.

By hardcoding this restriction, the code assumes that fixed interest rate borrowing is permanently disabled. Such rigid enforcement could hinder adaptability and limit the protocolâ€™s ability to support diverse use cases.

---

### **Root Cause**

The root cause lies in the explicit enforcement of `InterestRateMode.VARIABLE` in the following lines of code:

 `ValidationLogic:validateBorrow`

```solidity
require(
    params.interestRateMode == DataTypes.InterestRateMode.VARIABLE,
    Errors.INVALID_INTEREST_RATE_MODE_SELECTED
);
```

 `ValidationLogic:validateRepay`

```solidity
require(
    params.interestRateMode == DataTypes.InterestRateMode.VARIABLE,
    Errors.INVALID_INTEREST_RATE_MODE_SELECTED
);
```

### **Impact**

The impact of this issue is **medium**, as it limits the protocol's flexibility and potential use cases. While the current design might intentionally restrict fixed interest rate borrowing, such enforcement eliminates the possibility of enabling both modes in future configurations or deployments without modifying the code.

This limitation could lead to missed opportunities for supporting diverse borrower preferences and adapting to changing market demands.

---

### **Proof of Concept (PoC)**

1. Attempt to borrow with `InterestRateMode.STABLE`:

```solidity
params.interestRateMode = DataTypes.InterestRateMode.STABLE;
validateBorrow(params);
// Transaction fails with INVALID_INTEREST_RATE_MODE_SELECTED error.
```

2. Attempt to repay with `InterestRateMode.STABLE`:

```solidity
params.interestRateMode = DataTypes.InterestRateMode.STABLE;
validateRepay(params);
// Transaction fails with INVALID_INTEREST_RATE_MODE_SELECTED error.
```

These examples demonstrate how the current implementation explicitly rejects fixed interest rate usage, even if such a feature might be desired in the future.

---

### **Recommended Mitigation**

Refactor the `validateBorrow` and `validateRepay` functions to allow both `InterestRateMode.VARIABLE` and `InterestRateMode.STABLE`, unless explicitly restricted by protocol configuration. This change can be implemented by checking against a configurable parameter.

#### Suggested Code Fix:

Add a configuration parameter to enable or disable fixed interest rate mode. Modify the `require` statements as follows:

```solidity
require(
    params.interestRateMode == DataTypes.InterestRateMode.VARIABLE || 
    params.interestRateMode == DataTypes.InterestRateMode.STABLE,
    Errors.INVALID_INTEREST_RATE_MODE_SELECTED
);

// Optionally, enforce restrictions via configuration:
require(
    (params.interestRateMode == DataTypes.InterestRateMode.STABLE && config.stableRateEnabled) ||
    (params.interestRateMode == DataTypes.InterestRateMode.VARIABLE && config.variableRateEnabled),
    Errors.INVALID_INTEREST_RATE_MODE_SELECTED
);
```

This approach ensures that both interest rate modes are supported, with the ability to enable or disable specific modes as needed.
