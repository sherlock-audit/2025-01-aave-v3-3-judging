# Overflow probability when minting new tokens in BridgeLogic

### Summary

Using the BridgeLogic contract to implement the minting of new tokens can result in an overflow due to a casting and storing the result in the storage variable.

### Root Cause

First of all, let's take a look on the [executeMintUnbacked()](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/BridgeLogic.sol#L57) function:

```solidity
  function executeMintUnbacked(
    mapping(address => DataTypes.ReserveData) storage reservesData,
    mapping(uint256 => address) storage reservesList,
    DataTypes.UserConfigurationMap storage userConfig,
    address asset,
    uint256 amount,
    address onBehalfOf,
    uint16 referralCode
  ) external {
    DataTypes.ReserveData storage reserve = reservesData[asset];
    DataTypes.ReserveCache memory reserveCache = reserve.cache();

    reserve.updateState(reserveCache);

    ValidationLogic.validateSupply(reserveCache, reserve, amount, onBehalfOf);

    uint256 unbackedMintCap = reserveCache.reserveConfiguration.getUnbackedMintCap();
    uint256 reserveDecimals = reserveCache.reserveConfiguration.getDecimals();

@>    uint256 unbacked = reserve.unbacked += amount.toUint128();

    require(
      unbacked <= unbackedMintCap * (10 ** reserveDecimals),
      Errors.UNBACKED_MINT_CAP_EXCEEDED
    );

    reserve.updateInterestRatesAndVirtualBalance(reserveCache, asset, 0, 0);

    ...
  }
```

Here we get the information about reserve and cashe, update cash and calculating the `unbacked` value;

If we take a look on the [unbacked](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/types/DataTypes.sol#L73) variable in the DataTypes, we'll see that it is type of `uint128`.

So on the line:  

`uint256 unbacked = reserve.unbacked += amount.toUint128();`

firstly the STORAGE variable of `reserve.unbacked` will be updated in a math operation and later saved in the `uint256 unbacked` variable.

Casting `amount.toUint128()` will not save it from overflow,  as this line can be interpreted:

`uint256 = storage uint128 = uint128 + uint128;`

As can be seen from the contract code, this variable should be later checked against the uint256 value, so the team assumed there will no problem. 

But the overflow can still happen if any of the uint128 will be close to the max possible value.

So the function will revert and bridging token process will fail.

### Internal Pre-conditions

_No response_

### External Pre-conditions

_No response_

### Attack Path

_No response_

### Impact

Users will not be able to bridge and mint new tokens because of overflow. 

### PoC

_No response_

### Mitigation

As it assumed to be saved in a local uint256 variable, it is recommended to save a storage variable in a new local variable and cast the result of math operation.
