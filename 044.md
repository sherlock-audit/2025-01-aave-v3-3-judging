# Incorrect handling of bad debt with zero collateral positions can cause an infinite deficit increase.

### **Summary**  
The lack of a condition to check whether a reserve's `deficit` has already been updated for bad debt will cause repeated additions to the `deficit` in **`_burnDebtTokens`**, leading to a continually growing `deficit` for zero-collateral positions during multiple calls to liquidation or debt-cleanup functions.

---

### **Root Cause**  
In `LiquidationLogic.sol` (within `_burnDebtTokens`), the protocol assumes that `outstandingDebt` after liquidation should always be [added to](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L580) `deficit`. However, if [hasNoCollateralLeft](https://github.com/sherlock-audit/2025-01-aave-v3-3/blob/main/aave-v3-origin/src/contracts/protocol/libraries/logic/LiquidationLogic.sol#L552)is `true` and the reserve already contains the bad debt from previous calls, the `deficit` will be incremented repeatedly without bounds.

---

### **Internal Pre-conditions**  
1. The user has no collateral left (`hasNoCollateralLeft == true`).
2. `outstandingDebt != 0` (e.g., from accrued interest or partial liquidation).
3. The function `_burnDebtTokens` is called multiple times for the same reserve and user.

---

### **External Pre-conditions**  
None (assumes trusted dependencies).

---

### **Attack Path**  
1. A user becomes undercollateralized or leaves bad debt after liquidation.  
2. The `deficit` for the reserve is updated in `_burnDebtTokens` during the first call.  
3. The same user’s bad debt triggers multiple liquidation or debt cleanup calls, and the `deficit` is incremented each time without checking if it already includes the user's outstanding debt.  

---

### **Impact**  
The protocol suffers an **unbounded inflation of the reserve’s `deficit`**, making it impossible to accurately track the actual bad debt. This could mislead governance and treasury operations, ultimately damaging the protocol's financial integrity.

---

### **Mitigation**  
Add a check to ensure that the user's outstanding debt is only added to the reserve's `deficit` once.
